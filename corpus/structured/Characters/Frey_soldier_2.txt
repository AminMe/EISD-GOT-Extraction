 Season 3 

The soldier is relaxing with three other Frey men by a campfire, boasting about the Red Wedding. Another soldier in particular mocks the death of Catelyn Stark and the desecration of Robb Stark's corpse, including attaching the head of his direwolf, Grey Wind, to it. This soldier reminds the other that he was the one who did it, to which the other soldier responds in the affirmative. This soldier is then the first to notice Arya Stark approaching from behind. After she asks to keep warm, the soldier orders her to fuck off, until she offers a coin to the other soldier. However, she quickly stabs the other soldier, prompting this soldier and the two others to take up arms. However, they're quickly slain by Sandor Clegane before they have a chance to hurt Arya.
