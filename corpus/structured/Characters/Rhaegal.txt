{{Quote|Viserion?  Rhaegal?|[[Daenerys Targaryen]] calling to her dragons.|The House of Black and White}}

'''Rhaegal '''is one of the [[dragons]] born on the [[Dothraki Sea]], along with [[Drogon]] and [[Viserion]]. Commanded by [[Daenerys Targaryen]], he was named for her brother, [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]. He is distinguishable by his green and bronze colored scales, and his yellow-orange colored wings.

==Physical appearance==
Most of Rhaegal's scales are emerald green, with a few bronze scales on the underside of his neck and tail. His frills and wings are yellow-orange colored, becoming a darker green near the wing-bones.

==Biography==
===[[Season 1]]===
[[File:Dragon Eggs.png|thumb|left|Rhaegal, the right, green dragon egg.]]
He is born along with his two siblings after Daenerys has their eggs placed on the funeral pyre erected for her deceased husband, Khal Drogo. As she rises unharmed from the ashes of the pyre on the morning following the funeral, he is cradled by Dany at the time.<ref>"[[Fire and Blood]]"</ref>

===[[Season 2]]===
[[File:Daenerys and dragons 2x10.png|thumb|Rhaegal and his brothers burn [[Pyat Pree]]]]
Rhaegal is taken along with his "brothers" to [[Qarth]]. He is stolen by [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]], along with Drogon and Viserion. As Daenerys enters the [[House of the Undying]] to retrieve them, she eventually finds her three dragons chained. [[Pyat Pree]] attempts to chain her with magic, claiming that her dragons make his magic strong, and that she makes them stronger, thus she will stay with them for an eternity. She whispers to her dragons the command of fire, and the three of them burn Pyat Pree alive, releasing his magic.<ref>"[[Valar Morghulis]]"</ref>

===[[Season 3]]===
[[File:Dragons at Yunkai.png|thumb|left|Rhaegal, Drogon and Viserion at Yunkai]]
Rhaegal, along with his brothers, accompanies [[Daenerys]] on her journey from [[Astapor]] and [[Yunkai]]. When Daenerys has a meeting with a [[Razdal mo Eraz]], of the [[Wise Masters]] of Yunkai, Rhaegal hisses at the slaver along with his brother Drogon when he comes too close to Daenerys. He then fights over a piece of meat with his brothers when Daenerys makes a show of force to intimidate Razdal.<ref>"[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)]]"</ref> After Daenerys frees the slaves of Yunkai, Rhaegal takes to the sky with his siblings at Daenerys's command; a show of both power and freedom.<ref>"[[Mhysa]]"</ref>

===[[Season 4]]===



[[File:Dragons imprisoned.png|thumb|Viserion and Rhaegal are imprisoned]]
Rhaegal is seen with his brother Viserion fighting over a dead lamb. Drogon, who is now visibly bigger than them, quickly takes the lamb as his brothers squeal for him to share. He sets the corpse down and the three begin to eat.<ref>"[[Two Swords]]"</ref> 
In response to Drogon's killing of a three-year old girl, Daenerys leads Viserion and Rhaegal into the catacombs of Meereen, where she chains them up.<ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

===[[Season 5]]===
[[File:Rhaegal_5x01.png|thumb|left|Rhaegal scares Daenerys]]Daenerys finally decides to reenter the catacombs to attempt to regain control over her dragons. Rhaegal and Viserion, who have grown even larger during their time in captivity, immediately lash out and breath fire at the sight of their mother who imprisoned them.<ref>[[The Wars to Come]]</ref>

Some time later, Daenerys, reeling over the death of Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], arrests the leaders of Meereen's great families and brings them to meet Rhaegal and Viserion. Rhaegal roasts one of nobles and tucks in, sharing the meal with Viserion. Her point proven, Daenerys leaves, sarcastically saying that she doesn't want to overfeed the dragons.<ref>"[[Kill the Boy]]"</ref>

==In the books==

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Rhaegal is much the same. In some ways he is essentially the "middle brother" of Daenerys's three dragons: Drogon is larger than both of his brothers and the most aggressive, while Viserion is the best behaved towards other people besides Daenerys. Rhaegal, meanwhile, is not as aggressive as Drogon but is also not as friendly as Viserion.

Like her biological son [[Rhaego]], Daenerys named Rhaegal in memory of her older brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], the last great champion of House Targaryen.

Rhaegal's name wasn't mentioned on-screen as of the end of Season 4, though it was stated in the Season 4 HBO Viewer's Guide, establishing that his name is the same in the TV continuity.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-4/episode-10/houses/5/house-targaryen ]</ref> His name was finally stated in on-screen dialogue in Season 5 episode 2, "[[The House of Black and White]]".

Daenerys refers to her three dragons as "brothers", but there is actually no specific reason to think that their eggs were all laid by the same dragon, or if the three eggs were even found in the same place or gathered individually. She may call them "brothers" more in the figurative sense that they were raised together.
