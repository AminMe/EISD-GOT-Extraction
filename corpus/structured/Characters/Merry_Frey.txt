 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is a granddaughter of Lord Walder named Merianne Frey, who is also known as Merry, who is eleven years old (not to be confused with Marianne Vance, daughter of Walder's daughter Maegelle, whose first name is spelled with an a not an e). She is the daughter of Ser Whalen Frey and Sylwa Paege. Whalen is the third child of Lord Walder's fourth wife, Alyssa Blackwood. Lame Lothar Frey is Walder's eldest child with Alyssa, making him Whalen's older brother and Merianne's uncle. 

Merry was one of the Frey women presented to Robb Stark when he came to the Twins for Lord Edmure Tully's wedding. When she corrects her grandfather on her name, he refers to her as Noisy, rather than dismissing her. See also References
