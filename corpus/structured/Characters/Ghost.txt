 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ghost is the quietest and stealthiest of the six wolf cubs. While the other wolves are darker-colored, Ghost is an albino and initially appears to be the runt of the litter, though he grows up to be as big as any of the others. Ghost's like-but-unlike nature appeals to Jon as a kindred spirit. Ghost's appearance is said to resemble that of the faces found on heart trees in the North. 

Jon finds him separated from his siblings, as he matured faster than the others: he was the first to open his eyes and walk on his own, and was attempting to find shelter away from their mother's corpse. Unlike in the TV series, Jon willingly takes Ghost as his own, countering Theon's suggestion to leave him to die. Like Jon Snow, the bastard outsider of his family, as the runt of the litter, Ghost had to grow up fast. 

In the books, it is emphasized that Ghost is unnaturally silent: Jon tells Tyrion that he named him Ghost partially because of his albino coloring, but also because of how little noise he makes. In the books, Ghost is completely mute, utterly silent making no sound of any kind. This wasn't found to translate well to the screen, so Ghost makes noises like growling at Rast in his bunk or whining at Gilly holding rabbits. 

Ghost accompanies Jon when he joins Qhorin's scouting group. Ghost participates in the killing of Qhorin and remains with Jon as he infiltrates Mance Rayder's host. Before going with the wildlings to scale the Wall, Jon orders Ghost to leave and attempt to return to Castle Black. Ghost departs into the forest, and Jon hopes he understood his command. Many weeks later, several days after the Battle of Castle Black is over Ghost returns to the Wall, and the two are overjoyed to be reunited. 

In the TV series, Ghost initially shadows Qhorin's scouting group, but he does not appear again after Jon is captured. Apparently, on his own initiative Ghost made his way back to the Fist of the First Men, the Watch's main base camp, but it had come under attack by the White Walkers. Ghost is later seen with the survivors, when he helps Jeor Mormont kill a wight that was attacking Samwell. Ghost apparently then tried to return to Castle Black alongside them, but when they reach Craster's Keep, Ghost somehow senses the coming danger, and retreats back into the Haunted Forest. Apparently the mutineers later captured him in the TV version, but when Jon leads a scouting force back to Craster's Keep to finish off the traitors he is reunited with Jon and brought back to Castle Black. Afterwards he is let loose during the wildling attack on the fortress to aid the defenders, and is seen to be by Jon's side at Castle Black in Season 5 - putting him back in synch with his book location. 

Melisandre warns Jon of daggers in the dark and advises him to keep Ghost near him all the time, but he does not listen to her because one of her visions (about a girl in grey on a dying horse) proved to be wrong. This turns to be a fatal mistake of Jon. 

In his last breath, Jon whispers Ghost - similarly to Robb, whose last words were Grey Wind. It is unknown if there is a connection between them.There is a fan speculation that Robb and Jon, in their last breath, managed to warg into their direwolves. It did not do any good for Robb, since Grey Wind was killed shortly after him. It is not the case with Jon, whose direwolf was not around when he was stabbed - he might have survived.\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-136487565856cca5d469583 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
