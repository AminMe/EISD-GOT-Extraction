Together with the rest of his order, he dwells in the mysterious House of the Undying, located within the city of Qarth.

When Daenerys travels to the House of the Undying to retrieve her dragons, Pyat Pree creates illusions around her as she travels throughout the House's chambers. When she reaches the room with her dragons, Pyat confronts her, saying that his magic was reborn when the dragons were born, that it is strongest in their presence, and that the dragons are strongest in hers. Using magic, he chains Daenerys, telling her she will stay with him for an eternity to fuel his magic; however, as he does this, he inadvertently provokes the dragons. Upon her saying dracarys, the dragons open fire on him, roasting him alive in seconds.Valar Morghulis\/ref data-rte-instance130814-212423337456cca5f7000bd classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Season 3

He, along withXaro Xhoan Daxos and Quaithe,approach Daenerys Targaryen in the ruined city of Vaes Tolorro(not included in the TV series) and invite her to Qarth(instead of greeting DaenerysatQarthin theTV show). Later on he invites her to the House of the Undying, and instructs her how to move inside without getting lost. 

In the books Preeshows no ability to conjure doubles; he doesn'tstealDaenerys'dragons, nortry to imprison her, neither is he killed. He is not a member of the Thirteen. 

After Daenerys steps out of the House of the Undying, Pyat Pree is angry at her for burning the palace and injuring his masters, the Undying. He draws a knife and charges at her, but is stopped by Drogon, Jhogo, and Rakharo. 

Daenerys soon learns that Pyat Pree is gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her. Thus she has no choice but to leave Qarth urgently. Currently Pyat Pree is still after her. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
