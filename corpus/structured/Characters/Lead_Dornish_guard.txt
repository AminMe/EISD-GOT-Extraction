 Background 

He is the lead guard of a Dornish patrol. Season 5 

 While riding along the Dornish coastline, the Dornish guard and his men discover Jaime Lannister and Bronn. Judging his accent, he assumes that Bronn is from King's Landing and asks them why they are so far from home. Bronn and Jaime try to convince the guard that their ship capsized in the night and they simply wish to return home. Suspicious of two armed travelers, the guard orders them to throw their swords in the sand. The two comply, but Bronn swiftly throws his knife at the lead guard which lands right in his throat, killing him.\Sons of the Harpy (episode)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-169002400756cca6f0b374b classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances 

 In the books 

In theA Song of Ice and Firenovels there is no parallel character, nor parallel fight scene. Jaime and Bronn do not travel to Dorne at all. Instead, Cersei sends SerBalon Swann, who goes to Dorne on an official mission to take Myrcella back, so he does not need to smuggle himself into the country, and does not have any similar violent encounter.
