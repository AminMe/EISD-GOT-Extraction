The A Song of Ice and Fire novels give more detail about the Grey King's life. He reigned for a thousand years with a mermaid as his wife and plotted his war against the Storm God. He supposedly wore robes of woven seaweed and a tall pale crown made from Nagga's teeth. From Nagga's bones he made his hall, the Grey King's Hall, which he heated with Nagga's living fire. When the Grey King died, the Storm God snuffed out the fire and the sea stole his throne. Only his hall remains. See also References
