 Background 

Daisy is a prostitute originally from Haystack Hall, in the Stormlands. Season 2 

She is a new prostitute in the brothel owned by Lord Petyr Baelish. She is learning about the brothel from Ros, impressed by the upmarket decor, and thinks that Armeca is beautiful. She is present when the infant Barra is killed by Lord Janos Slynt in front of her mother Mhaegen.\The North Remembers\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-144197550756cca614dbf5f classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

Daisy is sleeping with Grand Maester Pycelle when he is arrested by Tyrion Lannister for espionage. Tyrion pays her for her troubles.\What is Dead May Never Die\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-144197550756cca614dbf5f classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Tyrion later hires Ros and Daisy as a present for his nephew King Joffrey Baratheon. They wait for him in his chamber. When he arrives Ros wishes him a happy name day and then reaches for his crotch. He flinches and then instructs Ros to touch Daisy. He asks if Ros can hit Daisy and she spanks her gently. Joffrey asks if Tyrion sent them and Ros says that Tyrion chose them himself. Joffrey takes off his belt and gives it to Ros to use. He forces Ros to hit Daisy hard enough to make her scream. He hands Ros a stag’s head sceptre and she protests that too much pain will spoil the pleasure. He loads his crossbow as Ros warns him that his uncle might find out. He tells Ros that he wants Tyrion to find out and orders her to take Daisy to Tyrion’s chambers to show him what has happened or she will also be beaten. He aims the crossbow at Ros and orders her to begin.\Garden of Bones\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-144197550756cca614dbf5f classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / It is unknown if Daisy survived the beating as she is never seen in the brothel again.
