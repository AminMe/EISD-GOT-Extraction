However, the reality is that Cersei is cleaning house by removing anyone from court who isn't a dedicated Lannister-loyalist. Barristan's shock turns to outrage when Cersei announces that his position as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard is toÂ be given toÂ Jaime Lannister. Barristan openly denounces Jaime as "the man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!", causing CerseiÂ to angrily rebuke him. Varys tries to defuse the situation byÂ offering Selmy a keep to live in and servants to tend his needs out of respect for his years of service, but Ser Barristan bluntly refuses the offer, insulted atÂ the council's attempt to fob him off with "a hall to die in and men to bury me".

As a reward for his valor, Jaime was knighted by Arthur Dayne that day.

</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Five of King Aerys's Kingsguard were killed during Robert's Rebellion, all except for Barristan and Jaime Lannister. Rarely, if ever, have so many vacancies occurred at once in the Kingsguard. Many of the replacements were the result of political appointments made to appease other Houses rather than being selected for either valor or skill at arms. As a result, Robert's Kingsguard was considered to be one of the worst in its history, with many regarding Barristan and Jaime as the only true remaining knights of the Kingsguard. While Ser Jaime Lannister was considered to certainly be one of the most formidable swordsmen in all of the Seven Kingdoms, his retention in the group after his murder of King Aerys was particularly controversial. As a result, many throughout the realm considered Ser Barristan to be the only true and honorable living member of the Kingsguard. It is also mentioned that Selmy never wanted Jaime in the Kingsguard; before Robert's Rebellion, Selmy thought Jaime too young and unready and afterwardsÂ heÂ believed Jaime should be exiled to the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Night's Watch","link":"Night's Watch","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Night's Watch]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Night's_Watch" title="Night's Watch">Night's Watch</a>.

Varys' reasons for the dismissal become clear later, as Selmy can now join Daenerys Targaeryen, something Illyrio Mopatis arranges for him.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Later, Selmy admits: "I might be serving in King's Landing still if the vile boy upon the Iron Throne had not cast me aside, it shames me to admit.

It was at that pointÂ Barristan realized how far he had fallen, having spent so many yearsÂ defending the man who'd overthrown his rightful king and serving alongside treacherous scum like the Kingslayer and others just as bad;Â Barristan recognized that Robert had been a good warrior but a bad king,Â for he had no right to the throne he sat upon, and decided he had to find the rightful Targaryen heir to the Iron Throne and make amends for his sins, or die in the attempt.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Selmy sells his sword and armor, disguises himself as a beggar, and hides in the capital instead of returning to his family's lands, not wanting to cause them trouble because of Joffrey's quarrel with him.

Ned's execution was not what caused Selmy's change of heart - it was his earlier shameful dismissal by Joffrey. It is likely that had Selmy continued to serve Joffrey, he'd have stood still during the execution and done nothing to save Ned, the same way he acted years ago at the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"execution of Ned's father and brother","link":"Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|execution of Ned's father and brother]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Execution_of_Rickard_and_Brandon_Stark" title="Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark">execution of Ned's father and brother</a>, or in any other occasion he witnessed the mad king's atrocities.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">For some time afterwards, Ser Barristan's whereabouts are a mystery in Westeros. Renly asks <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Catelyn Stark","link":"Catelyn Stark","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Catelyn Stark]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Catelyn_Stark" title="Catelyn Stark">Catelyn Stark</a> if Barristan has joined Robb. He tells her that the rainbow cloak of his guard that he bestowed on Brienne was the one he had been saving for Barristan Selmy, as he had expected Selmy to show up to support him after being dismissed by Joffrey. When Catelyn confirms that Selmy is not with the Stark host, Renly assumes Barristan is with Stannis; as he prepares for battle with Stannis's army at Storm's End, Renly orders his knights to spare Selmy's life should they encounter him fighting for Stannis.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Tyrion arrives in King's Landing, he berates Queen Cersei for dismissing Barristan, whom he says is now sure to join up with one of their enemies. As a revered figure in Westeros, Barristan gives honor and prestige to whoever he serves. Him pledging to the cause of one of the rival claimants to the Iron Throne would give them legitimacy in the eyes of the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"smallfolk","link":"smallfolk","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[smallfolk]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Smallfolk" title="Smallfolk">smallfolk</a>, which Cersei is forced to admit she simply had not considered (one of a growing string of follies in which Cersei doesn't think out the obvious long-term repercussions of her actions). This is of course exactly what happens, but everyone assumed that Barristan would seek out the "rightful heir" by supporting the claim of Stannis Baratheon or possibly his younger brother Renly, or else might join the Starks. None suspected that Barristan would leave Westeros in search of the surviving <i>Targaryen</i> heir, Daenerys.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">While on the run, Barristan grows his hair and beard (much longer than in the show) as a precaution and adopts the alias "Arstan Whitebeard". The disguise works so well that no one recognizes him despite being famous all over Westeros and outside of it. When he first meets Daenerys, he presents himself as an old man in service to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Illyrio Mopatis","link":"Illyrio Mopatis","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Illyrio Mopatis]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Illyrio_Mopatis" title="Illyrio Mopatis">Illyrio Mopatis</a>, and squire to a eunuch pit-fighter named Strong Belwas, who has thus far not appeared in the series. Ser Barristan foils the assassination attempt on Dany using a staff, rather than a dagger as in the series. Furthermore, he meets her on the docks of Qarth as she is about to leave for Astapor, not on the docks of Astapor when she arrives there. Jorah is suspicious of "Arstan", whom he dubs "the world's oldest squire", but does not recognize him.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">During the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Siege of Meereen","link":"Siege of Meereen","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Siege of Meereen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Siege_of_Meereen" title="Siege of Meereen">Siege of Meereen</a>, Barristan saves Daenerys again, this time from <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Mero","link":"Mero","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Mero]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Mero" title="Mero">Mero</a>, using a staff to kill him. Jorah is astonished that a squire could kill Mero. Only then does he realize who "Arstan" really is, and Barristan reveals himself to Daenerys. He then reveals that Jorah was spying on her for Varys.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The TV series cut the "Arstan Whitebeard" subplot, simply having Barristan reveal his true identity as soon as he meets Daenerys and Jorah. It is possible that it was left out of the adaptation because while the true identity of "Arstan" was a surprise for book readers, TV viewers would visually recognize him. Moreover, the TV series moved around the chronology so that Daenerys only learns about Jorah's betrayal at the end of Season 4, meaning that Barristan would have had to spend two full seasons with Daenerys but without revealing Jorah's secret. The TV series <i>did</i> take care to alter events to make this change fit: Barristan is simply not present at the small council meeting in Season 1 during which Jorah's spying activities are being discussed. In Season 3's "<a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Kissed by Fire","link":"Kissed by Fire","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Kissed by Fire]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Kissed_by_Fire" title="Kissed by Fire">Kissed by Fire</a>", the writers went so far as to have Jorah fear that Barristan knew of his spying from small council meetings. Barristan explains that Robert did not trust an old Targaryen loyalist to attend his council meetings, and Barristan was content to avoid them anyway because he disliked politics. Thus the official change was established that in the TV continuity Barristan simply never knew that Jorah was spying.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Daenerys, disgusted, dismisses both men and gives them a suicide mission: to help her capture Meereen by infiltrating the city via its sewer system. Both men miraculously survive and help her take the city. They are called before her again. Barristan humbly begs forgiveness for his deception, and for abandoning her family after Robert took the throne. He explains that he kept his identity a secret to prevent the Lannisters discovering his whereabouts, and to observe Daenerys and get to know her better, to determine that she did not have the same <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"streak of insanity","link":"Targaryen madness","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Targaryen madness|streak of insanity]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Targaryen_madness" title="Targaryen madness">streak of insanity</a> as <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"her father","link":"Aerys II Targaryen","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen" title="Aerys II Targaryen">her father</a>.

She pardons Barristan and appoints him to her Queensguard, but banishes Jorah.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">While Daenerys and Hizdahr attend the games atÂ Daznak's Pit, Ser Barristan notices that Hizdahr offers Daenerys a bowl of honeyed locusts. Luckily (for the locusts are poisoned), she does not eat them. Strong Belwas eats a lot of them, soon becomes ill, and nearly dies as a result. The sudden appearance of Drogon causes a general panic, and Ser Barristan cannot get to his queen in time before she departs on Drogon's back. He blames himself for failing her, as much as he failed <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"her brother","link":"Rhaegar Targaryen","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Rhaegar Targaryen|her brother]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Rhaegar_Targaryen" title="Rhaegar Targaryen">her brother</a>, <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"her father","link":"Aerys II Targaryen","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Aerys_II_Targaryen" title="Aerys II Targaryen">her father</a>, even <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Robert","link":"Robert Baratheon","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Robert_Baratheon" title="Robert Baratheon">Robert</a>.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">As Hizdahr takes over Meereen, Ser Barristan is unsure whether he is bound to be loyal to him, in Daenerys's absence. Gradually he grows suspicious of Hizdahr, recalling how he begged Daenaerys to taste the poisoned locusts but did not eat them himself, and also in view of Hizdahr's indifference to Daenerys's departure and the way he behaves toward the Yunkai. Ser Barristan becomes convinced that Hizdahr collaborates with the Sons of the Harpy (maybe he is even their leader) and with the Yunkai Wise Masters as well - since all of them have a common goal: to dispose of Daenerys and restore the slave trade in Meereen. He confronts Hizdahr and demands to know who is the Harpy. Angry and frightened, Hizdahr calls his bodyguard Khrazz to protect him. Khrazz, two stone heavier than Ser Barristan and forty years younger, feels overconfident, which turns out to be his undoing. Ser Barristan kills him in a duel and throws Hizdahr in jail. Then he and other loyal servants of Daenerys form a council to rule Meereen in her absence, with Ser Barristan in charge as the Queen's Hand.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Ser Barristan is not killed by Sons of the Harpy and in fact survives the fifth novel to become a minor POV âthat is, a minor protagonist with his own chapters. In a sample chapter from <i>The Winds of Winter</i>, he is last seen leading his men in the upcoming large Battle of Meereen against the armies of Yunkai and their sellsword companies, as well as an outside Ironborn attack led by <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Victarion Greyjoy","link":"Victarion Greyjoy","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Victarion Greyjoy]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-31147260056cca5acb33fc" href="/wiki/Victarion_Greyjoy" title="Victarion Greyjoy">Victarion Greyjoy</a>.
