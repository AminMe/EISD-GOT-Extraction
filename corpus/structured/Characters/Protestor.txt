 In the books 

In A Song of Ice and Fire, a number of individuals, particularly begging brothers - the lowest among the clergy of the Faith of the Seven - begin to speak out against King Joffrey, Queen Cersei and Tyrion, incensed by Stannis' letter and the growing famine in King's Landing due to House Tyrell closing off the Roseroad - through which most foodstuffs reach the capital. These men also speak out against the leadership of the Faith of the Seven - both the High Septon and the Most Devout -, accusing them of corruption and fornication. References
