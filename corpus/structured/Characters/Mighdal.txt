 Master Mighdalis one of the formerGreat Masters of the Free City of Meereen. 

He owned a slave named Fennesz, who was tasked with educating the children of the household. After Daenerys Targaryen took the city and freed all the slaves, Fennesz asked her to be allowed to re-sell himself into slavery, as Mighdal and his family had treated him well. The queen allowed for Fennesz and Mighdal to sign a contract of employment, but only for a period of one year at a time.\The Children\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-148805863356cca8385e590 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character named Mighdal. His name was chosen by D.B. Weiss in honor of his beloved childhood friend David Migdal. 

The characters of Mighdal and Fennesz were invented to present a problem alluded to in the books, the plight of slaves whose lives actually worsened with freedom. References
