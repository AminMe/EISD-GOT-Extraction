Biography 

 Background 

Mord is the gaoler in charge of the Sky Cells in the Eyrie. He is in the service of House Arryn. He is slow witted and follows the orders of his betters. He is not so slow that he does not recognize opportunity when it is presented and he is the only reason Tyrion was able to make his play for freedom. Season 1 

 Tyrion Lannister is given into Mord's redoubtable care while a prisoner at the Eyrie.\The Wolf and the Lion\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-165621264956cca6817ab27 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / While Tyrion is trapped in the Sky Cells he tries to bargain for his freedom. Mord responds by beating him because he has no money to pay with. With great difficulty, Tyrion manages to bargain with Mord to allow him a fair hearing with Lysa Arryn, under the promise a Lannister always pays his debts. Tyrion is able to manipulate the situation during his audience with Lysa to demand a trial by combat, which is won in his favor by Bronn. Set free, Tyrion asks for his money-purse back from Rodrik Cassel. As Tyrion turns to leave, true to his word, he tosses the gold-filled purse to Mord, who looks back in delightful astonishment as Tyrion exits the Eyrie.\A Golden Crown\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-165621264956cca6817ab27 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances 

 Behind the scenes 

Actor Peter Dinklage was not wearing padding, and the scene where Mord beats him with a truncheon, even though it was a prop one, left him with bruises. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mord is a petty, dimwitted, and cruel man who delights in tormenting prisoners and telling them how they are going to fall out of the cells to their deaths on the rocks six hundred feet below the castle. He took Tyrion's coat when he first got there and the nights are freezing. 

Mord is described as very unattractive person: he has small dark eyes and rotting brown teeth. The left side of his face is scarred where an axe cut off his ear and part of his cheek. He has a large belly and thick, stubby-fingered hands. 

After Petyr Baelish kills Lysa Arryn and puts the blame on Marillion, Mord tortures Marillion by plucking his eyes and cutting several of his fingers, till he breaks down and confesses falsely that he killed Lysa. When Sansa looks at Mord, she notices that he has gold teeth. 

Mord means murder in Norwegian, Danish, German, Swedish and Polish, though it is uncertain if George R. R. Martin had any knowledge of this when he created the name. See also (spoilers from the books) References
