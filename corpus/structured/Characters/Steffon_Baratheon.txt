 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Steffon Baratheon is the son of the former Lord Baratheon and Rhaelle Targaryen, the sister of King Jaehaerys II and aunt of the Mad King. This relationship is what allowed Robert to claim the Iron Throne during Robert's Rebellion. 

Steffon Baratheon appears to have been an effective lord. He was once defeated by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen during a tournament. He was sent by King Aerys II to the Free Cities to find a bride for Prince Rhaegar, but he found no suitable matches. He did find a talented fool, however, one whom he believed would teach even Stannis to laugh. However, Lord Steffon's ship, the Windproud, sank in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End. His body and that of his wife, Lady Cassana of House Estermont, was never found. The fool, Patchface, did wash ashore, but the trauma of the event robbed him of his wits. 

In his youth, Steffon served as a page at King's Landing, and became close friends with Aerys and Tywin Lannister. As Aerys's relationship with Tywin deteriorated, many believed that the king would name Steffon as Hand of the Kingupon his return from the Free Cities; instead, matters only grew worse after Steffon's death, as Aerys became convinced that Tywin had arranged the sinking of the Windproud to prevent Steffon from taking his place.
