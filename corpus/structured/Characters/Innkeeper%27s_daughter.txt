In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no direct parallel to this character. This girl's story is more similar to a story Arya hears Chiswyck, one of the Mountain's men, telling at Harrenhal. He recalls that after the Tourney of the Hand Ser Gregor Clegane and his men gang raped Layna, the daughter of the keeper of an inn on the Goldroad. Layna resisted but she had no chance against the Mountain and his men. When the girl's brother tried to intervene, he was killed by Rafford. Chiswyck estimates her to have been eighteen at the time of the rape, but Rafford corrects him by stating that she was only thirteen. The men find this hilarious, which angers Arya and influences her to name Chiswyck as the first to be killed by Jaqen H'ghar. 

When Arya and the Hound enter the Inn at the Crossroads, they encounter Polliver, the Tickler and a squire. Polliver sits with a girl in his lap, but she does not resist; no one else touches her; and there is no mentioning she is related to the innkeeper. Polliver shoves her away and stands to talk with the Hound. When the situation gets tense and it is clear that a brawl is imminent, the girl and the other locals leave the inn.
