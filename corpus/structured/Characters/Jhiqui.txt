 Background 

Jhiqui is a Dothraki woman in Drogo's khalasar. Season 1 

Jhiqui, Irri, and Doreah tend to Daenerys in her tent. Jhiqui doesn't say much, and comes across as silent and obedient. However she does side with Irri in saying that the moon is a goddess, and not a giant dragon egg as Doreah claims.\The Kingsroad\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-4792676356cca67ac43ab classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances 

 Behind the scenes 

Jhiqui has only appeared in a single episode. It is not clear if she remained loyal to Daenerys following the death of Drogo, though if she did it is unlikely she survived long as Daenery's entire remaining khalasar is shown on camera in Garden of Bones and she is not present. Nevertheless, a Dothraki handmaiden is shown in The Bear and the Maiden Fair, though it is unknown is she's meant to represent Jhiqui. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jhiqui is a member of a khalasar defeated in battle by Khal Drogo's. She was enslaved and later given to Daenerys to teach her the Dothraki language. 

In the books, Jhiqui is frequently seen with Irri, both in service to Daenerys. In the TV series, however, she appears only briefly in one scene. Thus, it is unclear of the TV version of Jhiqui remains in Daenerys' khalassar or was among those who abandoned her after Drogo's death. The TV series condensed most of her role with that of Irri.
