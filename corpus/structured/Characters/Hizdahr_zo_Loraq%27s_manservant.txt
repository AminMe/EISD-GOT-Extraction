Hizdahrzo Loraq's manservant is a recurring character in the fourth season. He is played by guest star Conor Watters. Biography 

He is a Meereenese man serving the House of Loraq. His clothing and lack of collar suggest that he is a free man working as a servant, not a slave, even prior to Daenerys's victory. Season 4 

He's alongside Hizdahr zo Loraq when the Great Masters gather over the walls of Meereen when Daenerys Targaryen and her army appear before the city gates to lay siege to the city.\Breaker of Chains\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-131927766556cca7ee9cffc classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

He later accompanies Hizdahr to petition the Queen on the matter of burying his father's remains. The manservant follows protocol by communicating (in Low Valyrian) with Missandei instead of having Hizdahr and Daenerys actually speak, but the queen has them dispense with the pageantry and orders Hizdahr to to address her directly.\The Laws of Gods and Men\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-131927766556cca7ee9cffc classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances
