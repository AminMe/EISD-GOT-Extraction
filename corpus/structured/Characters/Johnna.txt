Johnna and her sister are evacuated from Hardhome after Karsi agrees to Tormund and Jon Snow's plan to resettle the wildlings in The Gift, in exchange for military support when the White Walkers finally assail the Wall. As she loads them into a boat, Johnna and her sister ask Karsi if she'll go with them, to which their mother replies that she'll follow shortly. Karsi is killed shortly thereafter in the Massacre at Hardhome, but her daughters at that point have reached the safety of the Night's Watch ships. 

Johnna and her sister later march with Tormund and Jon at the each of the Wildling host when they arrive at Castle Black.\The Dance of Dragons\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-104755666056cca6e697bdc classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances
