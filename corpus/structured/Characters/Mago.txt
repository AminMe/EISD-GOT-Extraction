 Season 1 

Mago attends Drogo's wedding to the Westerosi exile Daenerys Targaryen. He watches as two warriors squabble over a dancer at the wedding.\Winter is Coming (episode)|Winter is Coming\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-61833187056cca66043452 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

Mago objects to Daenerys intervening and denying the Dothraki to take their share of the Lhazareen women as spoils of war. He refuses to recognize her authority as khaleesi, calling her a foreign whore, and also defies Drogo. The Khal fights him, disdainfully disarming himself and deliberately accepting an arakh wound to show contempt for Mago's combat skills before slitting his throat with his own weapon and then pulling his tongue out through the neck wound.\The Pointy End\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-61833187056cca66043452 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

Shortly after Mago's death, the wound he gave Drogo begin to festers, eventually leading to Drogo's incapacitation and subsequent death. Appearance 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mago is part of Khal Drogo's khalasar, serving under Ko Jhaqo. He complains that Daenerys deprived him of his rape victim, but then the book only depicts the conversational confrontation amongMago,DrogoandDaenerysaboutthis affair, and this section concludes withDrogoorally denyingMago; no following forceconflictis described. On the other hand,Drogo was injured not by Mago, but during a battle against the khalasar of Khal Ogo. 

Following Drogo's death, Mago becomes a bloodrider for Jhaqo, one of the several Kos that proclaim themselves Khals, followed by a portion of Drogo's Khalasar. He seizes Eroeh, the Lhazareen girl that Daenerys saved earlier from him (Eroeh isnot included in the TV series), then he and the other bloodriders gang-rape her, and finally cut her throat. When Daenerys hears about this, she swears that she will pay Mago back for what he did to Eroeh. So far she has not had a chance to fulfill her oath. 

In the DVD commentary for the episode The Pointy End, George R.R. Martin comments on the butterfly effect created when a character is killed off in the TV series, given that Mago continues to appear in the books. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) (spoilers from the books) References
