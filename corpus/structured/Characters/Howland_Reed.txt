 Behind the scenes 

Howland is mentioned in a press release accompanying the news of the casting of Meera and Jojen Reed.[http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/07\/13\/game-of-thrones-casting_n_1672550.html?reftopbar Huffington Post\/ref data-rte-instance130814-48300441056cca5faa0413 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Howland Reed is a member and the ruler of the crannogmen, the inhabitants of the Neck. Disparagingly called frog-eaters because their lands are in the swamps of the Neck, the Reeds and the crannogmen keep to themselves and rarely travel beyond their borders. However, Howland Reed was an exception to this, becoming a noted friend and ally of Lord Eddard Stark, fighting at his side during Robert's Rebellion. He remains one of House Stark's staunchest supporters but, so far, hasn't played a role in the War of the Five Kings. 

One point of note mentioned in the books is the fact that Howland Reed was with Ned when he finally rescued Lyanna Stark. Howland was one of only two survivors of that mission; the other was Ned himself. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
