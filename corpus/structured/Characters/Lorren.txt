 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Black Lorren is regarded as one of the most dangerous and formidable ironborn raiders, second only to Andrik the Unsmiling. He's described as a squat, thick man with a long black beard. 

When Theon goes to search for the Stark boys, he gives Lorren command over Winterfell and its residents as castellan. While Ser Rodrik is besieging Winterfell, it is Lorren who urges Theon to fight to the bitter end, but Theon tries instead to negotiate with the besiegers. Although Lorren does not actually defy Theon, he grows to despise him for his behavior, as it is considered weakness and cowardice in the eyes of ironborn. 

When Ramsay and his men turn on Theon and sack Winterfell and kill the ironborn, Lorren fights bravely. It takes four men to kill him. See also References
