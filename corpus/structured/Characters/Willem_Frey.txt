In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is a character named Willem Frey but he is a young grandson of Lord Walder Frey and the second son of Ser Cleos Frey (the analogous character of Ser Alton Lannister) and Jeyne Darry. This Willem Frey is only ten years old, and thus was never married. He serves as a page at Ashemark. He does not make an appearance in the books so far, and is only mentioned in the appendix.
