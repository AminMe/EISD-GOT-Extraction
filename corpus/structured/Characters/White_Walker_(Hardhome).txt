 Season 5 

During the attack on Hardhome, while Jon and Loboda search for a bag of dragon glass weapons inside a burning wildling hut, the White Walker gives chase, extinguishing the flames with his mere presence. Loboda tries to fight him to buy Jon time to retrieve the dragon glass but upon contact with the Walker's icy spear his axe shatters. Loboda is slain by the White Walker. Jon, though plainly outmatched, takes on the Walker until with both combatants are astonished to find that Longclaw doesn't shatter but successfully counters the strike from the Walker's spear. Jon lands a blow on the White Walker, causing it to instantly shatter into a cloud of icy dust and fragments.\Hardhome (episode)\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-176112759556cca641f40b0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /
