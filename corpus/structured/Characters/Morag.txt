 Season 4 

Months after the mutiny, in which a group of oathbreaking brothers of the Night's Watch seize Craster's Keep, Morag delivers Craster's last son to Karl Tanner, leader of the mutineers, and tells him he's intended to be given to the gods. Understanding she's referring to the White Walkers, Karl orders the baby to be abandoned at the Haunted Forest to be seized by the creatures.\Oathkeeper\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-69615702456cca6d1c4307 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

After a group of brothers of the Night's Watch raid Craster's Keep and kill all the mutineers, Jon Snow offers Craster's wives protection at Castle Black. Morag refuses, citing how the 'crows' led by Karl have treated them just like Craster did. Jon asks if they want to remain in Craster's Keep, causing Morag to spit on the ground and demand the place to be burned. Morag and the rest choose to find their own way.\First of His Name\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-69615702456cca6d1c4307 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there is no mention of a wife of Craster by the name of Morag. The fate of Craster's wives after the mutineers abandon Craster's Keep hasn't been mentioned yet. 

Although her backstory isn't detailed on-screen, writer Bryan Cogman explained that he had specific ideas for the character: The original idea behind Morag was that she was the first of the daughters who became Craster's wife. So she's the prime wife, if you will, and the matriarchal figure for these women. She knows she can't fight these mutineers and knows that without them, the White Walkers could destroy the wives. So there's a lot going on.http:\/\/www.makinggameofthrones.com\/production-diary\/2014\/4\/28\/interview-with-bryan-cogman MakingGameOfThrones.com\/ref data-rte-instance130814-69615702456cca6d1c4307 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
