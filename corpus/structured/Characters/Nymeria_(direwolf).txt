 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Nymeria is an exuberant and playful wolf, but is also fiercely defensive of Arya Stark. Arya names her for Nymeria, the warrior-queen of the Rhoynar who led her people to safety in Dorne, a thousand years before the events of the series. 

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, Nymeria is pronounced Nigh-MEER-ee-uh, as opposed to Nih-MER-ee-uh. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
