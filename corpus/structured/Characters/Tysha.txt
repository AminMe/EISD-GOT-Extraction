After Tywin found out that Tyrion had married a commoner he was furious - in part because Tywin's own father <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Tytos Lannister","link":"Tytos Lannister","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Tytos Lannister]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-180638026656cca5fe7276d" href="/wiki/Tytos_Lannister" title="Tytos Lannister">Tytos Lannister</a>, after Tywin's mother died, took a live-in mistress who was a commoner. Tytos treated the woman as Lady of Casterly Rock in all but name, gave her Tywin's mother's jewelry, and Tywin came to think of her as only a step above a common whore. When Tywin learned that Tyrion married a commoner, his reasoning was that no one could ever love Tyrion, and Tysha must only be after his wealth - just as Tytos's mistress was after his wealth - and because she was presumably only having sex with him for money, that essentially made her a "whore". In truth, she truly was just an innocent crofter's daughter who was attacked by rapers, but saved by Tyrion and Jaime on the road.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin threatened and forced Jaime to tell Tyrion that it was all an act he set up, just to show Tyrion a good time with his first woman. Apparently Tywin did this so Tyrion would never go looking after the girl, but possibly also the basic cruelty of robbing Tyrion of even the memory of her love by convincing him that it wasn't real. Jaime, however, thought his father simply wanted to annul the marriage, and had no idea what his father was planning to do. Simply annulling the marriage may have been cruel but it would have been within Tywin's rights as Tyrion's father, given that as the son of a noble family he could use Tyrion to create a marriage-alliance with another noble family at some point in the future (Tyrion would not have been the first young lord who drunkenly eloped then had the union annulled).
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin, however, fueled by anger at the memory of his own father, decided that he needed to teach Tyrion a lesson, also about daring to go behind his back like this. Thus when Tywin gave Tysha to his guards she <i>truly loved</i> Tyrion, and because their marriage was mutually consensual, in the sight of the gods she was in fact his wife (even if his father had it annulled).  Moreover, she was not a whore who was (admittedly without real consent) simply given over to Tywin's guards:  she was an innocent and terrified farm girl who Tywin truly had his guards gang-rape (she didn't struggle, but only because Tywin had secretly said he'd kill her if she resisted at all).  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Tyrion learns what really happened after so many years, bearing in mind how Tysha was gang-raped by the guards and by himself at Tywin's command, he is utterly consumed by deep rage. Jaime assures him he had no idea their father intended to have Tysha gang-raped, but Tyrion is not appeased. He strikes Jaime, then says he actually killed Joffrey (a lie, simply meant to hurt Jaime) - then accurately reveals that Cersei has not been faithful to him, as she has been having sex with their cousin Lancel, sellswords she needed to sway to her allegiance, and possibly the court fool Moon Boy for all Tyrion knows.  Then he sets out to find Tywin. Arguably he might not have wanted to actually kill his father, but he wanted to interrogate him about where Tysha was.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Tyrion arrives at the Tower of the Hand he hear's a woman's voice and discovers Shae naked in his father's bed.  When Tyrion confronts her she says she never meant the things she said and that the queen made her. She also said his father frightens her. He asks her if she ever liked his touch and she said more than anything "my giant of Lannister." That was the worst thing she could have said and he strangles her in cold blood as she pleads for mercy.  After killing Shae, Tyrion takes a crossbow from the wall and catches Tywin on his privy. At first, Tywin cannot even remember who Tysha is - or claims he doesn't, as an insult. After more threats from Tyrion he thinks on it, and says she was his first whore - to which Tyrion says that the next time Tywin says the word "whore" he will kill him. Tywin calmly insists that he never killed Tysha: after Tyrion's "lesson" was done there was nothing more to do with the girl, so he simply sent her on her way.

<!-- RTE::{"spaces":0,"type":"LINE_BREAK"} -->Tyrion asks again, if he let her go, where is Tysha? Tywin, thinking Tyrion doesn't have the nerve to resist him, deliberately mocks his earlier threat by responding, "<i>Wherever whores go.</i>" -- at which Tyrion promptly shoots him. Tyrion only shoots Tywin with one crossbow bolt: it impales him above the groin, most likely rupturing his intestines. With his dying breath Tywin says that Tyrion is no son of his, to which Tyrion counters that he is; he is Tywin "writ small". Tywin dies quickly and then voids his bowels. Tyrion walks away noting that the oft repeated jape about his father was a another lie: Tywin Lannister, in the end, did not shit gold.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">So far in the novels, it is unknown what has become of Tysha, and whether she is still alive.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When asked at SDCC 2014 why Tysha was not mentioned as the <i>main reason</i> that Tyrion kills his father, Benioff and Weiss briefly and vaguely replied that there simply wasn't enough time to fit every subplot from the books into the adaptation - this despite the fact that they mentioned her at least once in every previous season. It isn't clear if they meant not enough time <i>in Season 4</i>, or perhaps, that they grew afraid that casual viewers might not remember the previous mentions of Tysha in past seasons, so they changed their minds at the last minute and simply cut her out (this despite the fact that a scene between Tyrion and Jaime discussing <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Orson Lannister","link":"Orson Lannister","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Orson Lannister]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-180638026656cca5fe7276d" href="/wiki/Orson_Lannister" title="Orson Lannister">Orson Lannister</a> and his beetles was invented for "<a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"The Mountain and the Viper","link":"The Mountain and the Viper","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-180638026656cca5fe7276d" href="/wiki/The_Mountain_and_the_Viper" title="The Mountain and the Viper">The Mountain and the Viper</a>" which lasted four full minutes).
