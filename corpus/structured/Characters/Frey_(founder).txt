Thefounder of House Freylooked at a map and noticed that the Trident speared the Neck, cutting off the North from the South. He realized that a river of gold would flow to the man who owned the right bridge across the water. He set in motion the building of this bridge, but did not see it to completion as this took three generations. Eventually, the Frey family obtained their much desired lordship, and the castle-bridge their founder began construction on as finished as The Twins.\House Frey (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-47145158456cca7454f62a classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books
