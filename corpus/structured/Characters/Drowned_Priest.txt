 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aeron Greyjoy presides over Theon's baptism, and he does this as soon as Theon arrives in Pyke, before taking him to the castle. Given that Aeron Damphair Greyjoy is Theon's uncle and an important character in later books in the series, the producers wanted to forgo having to make a major casting decision until his main storyline begins.http:\/\/winteriscoming.net\/2011\/09\/character-cuts-whos-in-and-whos-out-of-season-two\/ Winter is Coming article on season 2 casting cuts\/ref data-rte-instance130814-145533137856cca72f8a979 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Aeron is set to appear in the sixth season.
