 Quotes 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mycah is thirteen years old. He falls in with King Robert Baratheon's party as it returns to King's Landing from Winterfell and befriends Arya Stark. 

After the Hound defeats Beric Dondarrion, he teases Arya by telling her (without the slightest remorse or regret) I rode him Mycah down and cut him in half, and laughed. 

According to Jeyne Poole, Mycah has been cut up in so many pieces that his body was brought back to his father in a bag. At first the poor man had thought it was a slaughtered pig. See also References
