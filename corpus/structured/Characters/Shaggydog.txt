 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Shaggydog is the fiercest and least-disciplined of the six wolves, reflecting Rickon's willful nature. Bran thinks the wolf's name is stupid, but this might be expected as Rickon was only three years old when he named him, and only six in the TV series. Shaggy soon becomes a preferred name. He is described as black, with bright green eyes. See also (major spoilers from the books) References
