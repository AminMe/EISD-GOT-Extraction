 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Endrew Tarth is summoned from the Shadow Tower to serve as the new Master-at-arms of Castle Black after Lord Commander Jeor Mormont decides to send Alliser Thorne to King's Landing. 

During the Battle of Castle Black, Bowen Marsh chases three hundred wildlings led by the Weeper to the Shadow Tower, fights them at the Bridge of Skulls and defeats them, but at great cost: more than hundred brothers are killed, among them Ser Endrew. 

His relation with the main branch of House Tarth is not mentioned. See also (spoilers from the books) References
