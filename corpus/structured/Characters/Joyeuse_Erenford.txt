 Background 

Joyeuse Erenford was 15 years old and the eighth wife of Lord Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/guide\/houses\/frey\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Frey entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-200916584956cca61fa32c4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / She was a member of House Erenford a lesser house of landed knights from the Riverlands sworn to House Frey of the Twins. Season 1 

Catelyn Stark talks to a knight of House Frey at the Crossroads Inn. He tells her that Lord Walder is about to celebrate his 90th nameday and has taken another wife in celebration of the event. Tyrion Lannister finds this notion amusing, at least until the Frey knight agrees to help Catelyn take Tyrion prisoner for the attempted murder of her son Bran.\Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-200916584956cca61fa32c4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

 Arriving at the Twins, Catelyn greets Lord Walder Frey and his young, 15-year-old wife, Lady Joyeuse, whom Lord Walder gropes even as he speaks. Walder dismisses his family, including Joyeuse, while he and Catelyn haggle on what price the Starks will pay to be allowed to cross the river.\Baelor\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-200916584956cca61fa32c4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Season 3 

Lady Joyeuse is present at the main hall of the Twins when Robb Stark presents himself to pay his respects to Lord Walder and beg his forgiveness for the breaking of their marriage pact. She remains with her husband during the wedding ceremony of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey and sits beside him during the feast, but doesn't take part in the bedding. 

 When the massacre of the Stark household and bannermen begins, Joyeuse, visibly scared, hides under a table while the carnage takes place. Injured, Catelyn Stark takes her hostage and threatens to kill her if Robb is not allowed to leave the Twins untouched. However, Lord Walder refuses, boasting he can get a new wife. After Robb is murdered by Roose Bolton, Catelyn slits Joyeuse's throat.\The Rains of Castamere\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-200916584956cca61fa32c4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances
