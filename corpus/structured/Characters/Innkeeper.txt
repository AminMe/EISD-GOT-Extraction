When Arya Stark and Sandor Clegane arrive at his inn, the innkeeper is begging Polliver to stop his men from raping his daughter.

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Sandor warns the innkeeper that Polliver and the Tickler - who is still alive at this point, though Arya kills him in the ensuing fight - will kill him instead of paying for their drinks. This causes the innkeeper and the other people to leave the room. 

When Brienne encounters three of the Brave Companions (Timeon, Pyg and Shagwell), they tell her that Rorge killed the innkeeper after he told them about the bloody brawl in the inn. 

This innkeeper's story is more similar to a story Arya hears Chiswyck, one of the Mountain's men, telling at Harrenhal. He recalls that after the Tourney of the Hand Ser Gregor Clegane and his men gang raped Layna, the daughter of the keeper of an inn on the Goldroad. Chiswyck estimates her to have been eighteen at the time of the rape, but Rafford corrects him by stating that she was only thirteen. The men find this hilarious, which angers Arya and influences her to name Chiswyck as the first to be killed by Jaqen H'ghar. References
