 Background

Weasel aids the Tickler in the interrogation and torture of prisoners. While the Tickler asks questions, Weasel straps the victim, and then places a wooden bucket with a rat inside over the victim's bare chest. At the Tickler's command, Weasel begins to heat the bucket with a torch to make the rat claw its way out through the victim's chest.\Garden of Bones\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-130304540256cca6f4576c0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Weese is the understeward of the Wailing Tower in Harrenhal and a servant of House Whent that later submits to House Lannister. He is a cruel and abusive man, resorting to violence at the slightest provocation, even just for staring at him. He treats Arya and other servants very brutally. He, not Amory Lorch, is the second man whom Arya tells Jaqen H'ghar to kill, because he was mean to her. 

Weasel is a different character, a little girl about two years old whose real name is unknown. She and a woman whose right hand was cut off, perhaps her mother, were found by Yoren on the march north from King's Landing. The one-armed woman died shortly afterwards, leaving the girl in the custody of the caravan. When the Mountain and his men caught Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy Greenhands, Weasel managed to escape, and has not been seen since then. Arya takes her name as an alias while at the castle. For the TV series, the young girl Weasel has been removed and the name given to Weese. See also (spoilers from the books) (spoilers from the books) References
