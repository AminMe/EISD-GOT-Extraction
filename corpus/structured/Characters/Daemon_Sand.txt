 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Daemon Sand, also known as The Bastard of Godsgrace, is Ser Ryon Allyrion's natural born son. He serves Prince Oberyn Martell as squire, and received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself. There are also rumors that he is one of Oberyn's lovers, though this is seldom said to his face. 

Ser Daemon is close friends with Arianne Martell, daughter and heir of Prince Doran, and took her maidenhead when they were both fourteen. When Prince Doran learned of this he didn't seek to punish Daemon, but refused to allow him to marry his daughter. 

He is considered to be one of Dorne's finest swordsmen. 

House Allyrion belongs to the group known as Salty Dornishmen, who live along the coasts of Dorne and the Greenblood river system. This group has the most Rhoynar blood of all Dornishmen and generally possess olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes. Daemon's brief appearance in Season 4 of the TV series did not resemble this, but as it turns out, in the books he is not described as having classic salty Dornish features. Instead, he is said to have sky blue eyes and light sandy brown hair. Daemon is a bastard son, so the simple explanation may be that he takes after his non-Allyrion parent in looks, and this parent was either a stony Dornishman from the western mountains, or possibly from somewhere outside of Dorne entirely.
