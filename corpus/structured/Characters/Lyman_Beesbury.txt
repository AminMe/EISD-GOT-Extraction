 Background 

 Lord Lyman was a member of the Small Council under Viserys I Targaryen. When King Viserys died and Ser Criston Cole of the Kingsguard plotted to crown Viserys's son instead of his daughter and designated heir, the aged Lord Lyman protested, prompting Ser Criston to kill him before eyes of the entire council.\The Kingsguard (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-87048563956cca81b9dd67 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lyman Beesbury is never mentioned. He appears, however, in The Princess and the Queen short story. Lord Lyman was Lord of Honeyholt and the Master of Coin during the reign of Jaehaerys the Conciliator and also under Viserys I, as replacement of Prince Daemon Targaryen. He was eighty when Viserys I passed away. When the small council met to plot crowning Prince Aegon, Viserys's eldest son by his second wife, over Princess Rhaenyra, Viserys's designated heir, Lord Lyman soundly protested even though he was outnumbered. Ser Criston Cole silenced the discussion by slitting Lord Lyman's throat with his dagger. He was replaced as Master of Coin by Ser Tyland Lannister, the Master of Ships. See also References
