 In the books 

Among the captives that Gregor Clegane took to Harrenhal there was wizened old woman. Arya Stark overheard her complaining one night It's not just, it's not. We never did no treason, the others come in and took what they wanted, same as this bunch. Her friend disagreed, saying Lord Beric did us no hurt, though, and that red priest with him, he paid for all they took. The old woman answered disdainfully Paid? He took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it. Can I eat a bit of raggy old paper, I ask you? Will it give me eggs?. She looked about to see that no guards were near, and spat three times. There's for the Tullys and there's for the Lannisters and there's for the Starks. 

The old woman is not mentioned afterwards. References
