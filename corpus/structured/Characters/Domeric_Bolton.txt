Iron From Ice, episode 1 of Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series, features cut dialogue of Ramsay mentioning Domeric's death to Ethan Forrester and his mother, remarking sarcastically that he fell ill and mockingly expressing sorrow.\/ref data-rte-instance130814-18325392856cca62ab93df classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Domeric Bolton was the only son and heir of Lord Roose Bolton and Lady Bethany Ryswell, his second wife. According to Roose, Domeric was quiet but accomplished; he read history, played the harp and rode horses as if born on the saddle. Domeric's mother's younger sister, Lady Barbrey Dustin, was quite fond of him as he had served as a page for her at Barrowton. He also served as a squire for Lord Redfortin the Vale, who said Domeric had the makings of a tournament champion. Domeric enjoyed the company of Redfort's sons in the Vale and, longing for a brother of his own, rode up the Weeping Water to seek out his bastard half-brother despite his father's forbidding it. 

According to the Dreadfort's maester, Uthor, Domeric died of a sickness of the bowels. Roose and Lady Dustin, among others, strongly suspect Ramsay murdered Domeric with poison to take his place as Roose's heir. See also (spoilers from the books) References
