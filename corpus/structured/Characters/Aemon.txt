Aemon was actually offered the throne, beingÂ Maekar's eldest surviving son, but declined on account of his vows, thus allowing Aegon V "the Unlikely" to assume the throne. Aemon then joined the Night's Watch in the hope that having taken oaths as both a member of the maesters and then the Night's Watch to forsake any claim to inheritance, no one would think of him as a legitimate heir to be used as political pawn against his younger brother. Despite being isolated at the Wall for many decades and unable to travel due to his increasing age, Aemon knew Prince <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Rhaegar Targaryen","link":"Rhaegar Targaryen","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-181782288256cca5aa0d781" href="/wiki/Rhaegar_Targaryen" title="Rhaegar Targaryen">Rhaegar Targaryen</a> well because they regularly corresponded via messenger-raven, making Aemon's decision not to leave the Wall all the more painful.

</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Aemon began training to be a maester when he was 9 or 10 years old, and finished his studies when he was 19, during the reign of his uncle King <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Aerys I","link":"Aerys I Targaryen","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Aerys I Targaryen|Aerys I]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-181782288256cca5aa0d781" href="/wiki/Aerys_I_Targaryen" title="Aerys I Targaryen">Aerys I</a> (Pycelle was only a baby at the time). The <i>Dunk and Egg</i> short stories begin about two years after Aemon left to train at the Citadel, so while he is alive in that timeframe he does not prominently appear (though his brothers do). When he received his chain of office, Aemon's father asked him to come to King's Landing to serve on his small council, but fearing that this would cause him to clash with the Grand Maester, Aemon chose instead to serve as at <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Dragonstone","link":"Dragonstone (castle)","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Dragonstone (castle)|Dragonstone]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-181782288256cca5aa0d781" href="/wiki/Dragonstone_(castle)" title="Dragonstone (castle)">Dragonstone</a>. Aemon joined the Night's Watch when he was 35, following the death of his father and succession of Aegon V, meaning that by the time Jon Snow joined the Night's Watch Aemon had been at the Wall for about 65 years.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the books, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont makes it clear to Jon Snow that he is fully aware that Aemon is actually a Targaryen. However, he saw no reason to tell Robert Baratheon, as the rules of the Night's Watch are that any member sheds all previous family ties, and the Night's Watch are their family now. Further, Aemon was already a blind old man, and a respected member of the Night's Watch for decades. Aemon took no particular action in support of House Targaryen when it was overthrown by Robert, so Mormont was confident that Aemon held true to his vows and no longer considered himself a Targaryen.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Other characters later point out that it is somewhat unusual that Aemon, a respected member of the Order of Maesters for decades, was never promoted to the rank of <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Archmaester","link":"Archmaester","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Archmaester]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-181782288256cca5aa0d781" href="/wiki/Archmaester" title="Archmaester">Archmaester</a>, to become part of the ruling <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Conclave","link":"Conclave","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Conclave]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-181782288256cca5aa0d781" href="/wiki/Conclave" title="Conclave">Conclave</a> in <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Oldtown","link":"Oldtown","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Oldtown]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-181782288256cca5aa0d781" href="/wiki/Oldtown" title="Oldtown">Oldtown</a>. It is speculated that the Conclave was wary about making a member of the royal family an Archmaester, given the entanglements this might create with the Targaryens. Whatever the case, the entire reason that Aemon joined the Night's Watch was to move as far away from the centers of power as possible, so it is probable that even if he were asked he would have declined a promotion to Archmaester at the Citadel.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Aemon is 99 years old in the first novel. Actor Peter Vaughan was 88 years old during Season 1. While portraying the blind Aemon, Vaughan is himself partially blind.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Aemon should have the rare and distinctive purple-colored irises of House Targaryen, though no one ever mentions it - and they might deduce his secret past as a Targaryen from this. More probably, his blind eyes are apparently so white with cataracts that no one can tell what their original color was.

A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn, and Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. When he was born they named him for aÂ heroÂ who had died too young, but though he lived a long long time, his own life was no less heroic. No man was wiser, or gentler, or kinder.
