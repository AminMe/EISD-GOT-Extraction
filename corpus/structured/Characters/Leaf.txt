<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the <i><a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"A Song of Ice and Fire","link":"A Song of Ice and Fire","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-110536986656cca61435bda" href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, Leaf is a Child of the Forest in service to the Three-eyed raven. She is described as having nut-brown skin that is dappled like a deer's with paler spots, large ears, large liquid gold and green eyes which are slit like a cat's eyes. Her hair is a tangle of brown, red and gold, autumn colors, with vines and twigs and withered flowers woven through it. She wears a cloak of leaves. Bran thinks that from far away Leaf looks no older than himself or one of his sisters, but close at hand she seems far older. She has a woman’s voice, high and sweet, with a strange music in it like none Bran has ever heard, and a deep sadness.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Her true name is unknown: it is in the True Tongue of the Children, thus it is very long and also possibly unpronounceable by humans. "Leaf" is a moniker given to her by Bran.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Leaf says that she was born during "the time of the dragon", apparently meaning at some point after <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Aegon I Targaryen","link":"Aegon I Targaryen","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Aegon I Targaryen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-110536986656cca61435bda" href="/wiki/Aegon_I_Targaryen" title="Aegon I Targaryen">Aegon I Targaryen</a> conquered and united the Seven Kingdoms <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"300 years ago","link":"War of Conquest","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[War of Conquest|300 years ago]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-110536986656cca61435bda" href="/wiki/War_of_Conquest" title="War of Conquest">300 years ago</a>. She is at least two centuries old because she also says that she secretly walked the world of men for 200 years observing them from the forests before growing weary and deciding to return home to the hidden cave beyond the Wall.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The novels have never described the Children of the Forest casting fireballs the way that Leaf seems to in the Season 4 finale - though in the scene, Leaf might be throwing some kind of volatile object at the wights (the camera doesn't focus on her hand).  Whatever the case, they are described as magically powerful in the novels and have only briefly appeared in the fifth book - so it is possible that they <i>can</i> cast fireballs in the novels, and it just hasn't been seen yet.  In the book version of the scene, Leaf lights the wights on fire using a torch, by darting around and between them with amazing speed and agility.
