 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Jaremy is an officer in the rangers of the Night's Watch. Ser Jaremy attends the officers meeting with Tyrion Lannister and recalls being sent to the Wall by Tywin Lannister after fighting for House Targaryen in the Sack of King's Landing during Robert's Rebellion. It is Ser Jaremy rather than Ser Alliser who challenges Sam about his decision to take his vows in the Godswood. He is not named as being part of the escort to the Godswood. He identifies the bodies when they are returned to Castle Black. 

Ser Jaremy and four other men were killed by the wight Jafer Flowers. Jaremy managed to hack the wight's head off, but was killed when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels. 

Give that Ser Jaremy is not shown to be killed in the episode, it is possible that he simply wasn't killed in the TV continuity. See also References
