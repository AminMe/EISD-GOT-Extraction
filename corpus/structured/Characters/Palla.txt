In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Palla is also the daughter of Farlen the kennelmaster. She is gang raped by the ironborn including Drennan when Winterfell is captured and Theon has the men whipped to show people of Wintefell he means to be just, although they still blame him for the rape, which Theon considers unfair. Later, after Bran and Rickon escape he threatens Palla's safety if her father will not lead the search to find them with the Winterfell dogs. When the northern collaborator Reek - actually a disguised Ramsay Snow - offers to get Dreadfort men to aid Theon against a siege of Northmen led by Ser Rodrik Cassel and other northern nobles, he demands Palla as his reward. 

Following the Sack of Winterfell, Palla is brought to the Dreadfort. Her fate is unknown. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
