 Background 

Argalia Baratheon was the wife of Orys Baratheon, the first Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and is the distant ancestor of King Robert Baratheon and his brothers Stannis and Renly. 

Orys, a commander in the army of Aegon the Conqueror and his bastard half-brother, had been sent by Aegon to seize Storm's End, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings and capital of the Stormlands. Orys defeated King Argilac the Arrogant and took not only Storm's End but also his sigil - the black stag and his words, Ours is the Fury - as well as Argalia, to cement his rule over the Stormlands. He became the first Lord Paramount of the Stormlands.\House Baratheon (Complete Guide to Westeros)\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-66128004456cca75707a94 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Season 1

 In the books 

A sample chapter posted on April 17, 2014 to George R.R. Martin's website from the unpublished The World of Ice and Fire, a companion book to the A Song of Ice and Fire novel series, reveals that Argilac's daughter was named Argella Durrandon. Argilac offered Argella's hand in marriage to Aegon the Conqueror himself in return for a military alliance against King Harren the Black of the ironborn, whom Argilac feared was planning an attack on the Stormlands. Aegon refused, instead offering the hand of Orys. Argilac spurned the offer of a bastard and severed the hands of Aegon's envoy in protest. 

When Orys defeated Argilac at the Battle of the Last Storm, Argella declared herself the Storm Queen and vowed to fight on. Her own vassals refused to obey, instead delivering her to Orys naked and in chains. Orys treated her with courtesy and they later married. While Orys is reported to have treated her chivalrously, Argella's feelings towards Orys remain unknown. 

The name of Argalia is the creation of Bryan Cogman, who wrote the entries in the Lineages and Histories book. See also References
