 Behind the scenes 

The smith is played by behind-the-scenes artisan and weaponsmith Tommy Dunne, who forges the weapons used in the series. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ice is re-forged by Tobho Mott rather than a smith from Volantis. The knowledge of reworking Valyrian steel is still a closely guarded secret, but by the smiths of Qohor, who number much more than three. The sword smith in the episode is not stated to be Volantene, only established there, so it's possible he could still be Qohorik. References
