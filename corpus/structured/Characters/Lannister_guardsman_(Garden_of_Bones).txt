 Background 

The unnamed Lannister guardsman is on sentry duty at the camp of the Lannister forces commanded by Ser Stafford Lannister on the way to reinforce the army of Tywin Lannister in the Riverlands. Season 2 

He is on guard duty with Rennick at the perimeter of Stafford Lannister's camp prior to the Battle of Oxcross. They discuss who is the greatest swordsman in the Seven Kingdoms. He argues for Ser Gregor Clegane and Ser Loras Tyrell over Rennick's contrary opinions. 

 He notices that the horses seem to be restless, but Rennick thinks that is just because they are under trees in shadows. Suddenly, Rennick acts as if he hears something and is concerned. Lannister guardsman follows him hesitantly. When Rennick draws his sword, he thinks they are about to be attacked, but then Rennick passes gas and starts laughing. Rennick starts urinating on the ground and continues to laugh at his joke ignoring the continued restlessness of the horses. The Lannister guardsman realizes something is out there and screams Rennick's name. Rennick looks up just as Grey Wind, Robb Stark's direwolf leaps out of the trees. Robb Stark has sent Grey Wind to attack the horses to cause confusion when the Stark army attacks the camp.\Garden of Bones\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-169960059056cca7af4f26b classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearance
