</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Even more than her sisters, Obara inherited her father's martial prowess, particularly his skill with a spear. She is a very tough warrior and the most overtly martial of the Sand Snakes. The other Sand Snakes will change out of their light leather armor when traveling in the hot deserts of Dorne, but Obara always wears her leather armor. She also tends to dress in a more masculine style than her sisters, even when not in combat. When she sees an obstacle, she does not attempt to undermine it with deception or intrigue, but will attack it head-on, relying on her skill and the strength of her weapons. This is in contrast with her sister <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Nymeria","link":"Nymeria Sand","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-204771405356cca5f33201c" href="/wiki/Nymeria_Sand" title="Nymeria Sand">Nymeria</a>, who prefers to hold off and analyze her foes to calculate a more efficient means of defeating them.<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/www.telegraphindia.com\/1150329\/jsp\/t2\/story_11347.jsp#.VR6xovnF9Cj]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-204771405356cca5f33201c" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Obara is the Sand Snake most like their father. He taught her the ways of war himself, training her in the use of a traditional Dornish spear like he used. Unlike most Dornishmen, who are overtly passionate, Obara is staunchly disciplined to not overtly display her emotions. This is largely due to her origins: unlike her sisters Nymeria and Tyene, Obara's mother was not a noblewoman, so when Oberyn came to take her to court, she had to choose between staying or going, the latter meaning she would never see her mother again. As a result, she has a cold and hardened demeanor, though she deeply loves her family.<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/nypost.com\/2015\/04\/06\/meet-the-newest-badass-beauties-of-game-of-thrones\/]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-204771405356cca5f33201c" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" /> This is not to say that Obara is the most rational of the sisters (Nymeria is the most rational and calculating one). She is actually quite irrational and ruled by her emotions, she just doesn't outwardly show them that much. The difference is that in a situation where <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Tyene","link":"Tyene Sand","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Tyene Sand|Tyene]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-204771405356cca5f33201c" href="/wiki/Tyene_Sand" title="Tyene Sand">Tyene</a> would aggressively shout insults at an enemy and attack them, Obara would just silently walk straight up to them and stab them without saying a word. Nymeria, in contrast, would hold back and attempt to assess if there would be a more opportune moment to strike at a later time.<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/variety.com\/2015\/tv\/news\/game-of-thrones-sand-snakes-oberyn-sons-of-the-harpy-1201486483\/ ]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-204771405356cca5f33201c" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Obara is loosely the lead Sand Snake, because she is eldest and probably the best fighter. Her sister Nymeria does nothing without her approval. Her father Oberyn and Nymeria were the only two people that Obara ever fully trusted. As her close confident, Nymeria is also the only person who can say "no" to Obara: while they may seem to argue at times, conversely this is because Nymeria is the <i>only</i> person that Obara will at least pay heed to - for anyone else, arguing with Obara is useless once she has her mind set on something. Nymeria is the only person Obara will ever take advice from (after their father's death).<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/variety.com\/2015\/tv\/news\/game-of-thrones-sand-snakes-oberyn-sons-of-the-harpy-1201486483\/]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-204771405356cca5f33201c" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />

Oberyn tossed his spear at Obara's feet and said: <i>"girl or boy, we fight our battles, but the gods let us choose our weapons."</i> He pointed to the spear and then to her mother's tears, and Obara picked up the spear.

However, the battle is quickly broken up by Areo Hotah and the rest of Doran's personal guard. Obara angrily challenges Areo by saying she fights for Dorne, asking who he fights for; Areo simply repeats his command that she drop her weapon.

She is the least pretty and the most aggressive of all the Sand Snakes. She is the first Sand Snake introduced in the novels.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When her father came to claim her, her mother did not want him to take her. He threw a spear down at her mother's feet and slapped her mother. Then Oberyn asked Obara which weapon, the spear or the tears, Obara chose the spear. Her mother drank herself to death within a year.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">She is prickly, hot-tempered woman who is given to martial pursuits as she considers herself a warrior, wielding a spear, a whip, and a round shield of steel and copper. She is hard, quick, and strong. She is fond of wine and is a confident rider who uses spurs, often to the point where the animal is bloody, and always rides stallions. Obara is a big-boned woman near to thirty, long-legged, with close-set eyes and rat-brown hair. 
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Obara in the books is the daughter of a whore from Oldtown in the Reach, but the casting announcement stated that TV-Obara is the daughter of a "Dornish peasant girl" that caught Oberyn's eye. The difference is not particularly drastic, but it might alter Obara's complex relationship with Oberyn - though the general point stands that Obara's mother wasn't of noble birth, unlike the mothers of some of the other Sand Snakes such as Nymeria Sand. Either way, Obara in the books generally resembles other "salty Dornishmen". Keisha Castle Hughes is herself half-Maori. The character might also be younger in the series; Castle-Hughes is only 25.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">It is Obara and not Ellaria Sand who confronts Doran Martell at the Water Gardens. She chides him angrily for doing nothing to avenge her father, declares that she wishes to drive her spear into Tywin’s belly, and demands that he will give her and Nymeria his and Lord Yronwood's hosts, that she can sack Oldtown while Nymeria takes the Kingsroad. Unlike in the show, she does not intend to harm Myrcella. Doran tells her that he will think it over and send her his answer at Sunspear. She says "So long as the word is war" and leaves. Maester Caleotte warns Doran that Obara is likely to inflame the common people. Doran agrees, returns to Sunspear and takes steps to make certain Obara and the other Sand Snakes will not ingnite a war.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">After Ser Balon Swann arrives at Dorne to take Myrcella back, Doran releases his nieces. He orders Obara to lead Ser Balon in chasing after Darkstar, who nearly killed Myrcella, and left her disfigured. Obara swears grudgingly that she will serve her uncle.
