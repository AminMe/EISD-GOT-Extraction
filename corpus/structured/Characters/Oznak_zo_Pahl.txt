 Biography 
Season 4
When Daenerys Targaryen arrives at the doors of Meereen, Oznak zo Pahl is sent out as its champion to duel a champion of Daenerys' choosing. He insults her and her Unsullied by urinating in their direction, mocking their status as eunuchs and accusing Daenerys of being a man who hides his genitals in his anus. Daenerys chooses Daario Naharis, the least valuable of her party, to battle him. Daario Naharis defeats him by throwing a knife into the eye of Oznak's horse, causing it to fall and him with it. Pahl attempts to rise, but is quickly decapitated. Daario returns Pahl's gesture by urinating toward Meereen.Breaker of Chains

Oznak zo Pahl's taunting of Daenerys, translated:

Quote|I fart in your general direction, son of a window-dresser! Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!  Go and boil your bottom, son of a silly person!  I wave my private parts at your aunties!  I don’t want to talk to you no more you empty-headed animal food trough wiper!  I blow my nose at you, so-called Dragon Queen, you and all your silly Westerosi kaniggets!|Oznak zo Pahl to Daenerys, translated|Breaker of Chains

Behind the scenes

Executive producer Dan Weiss came up with the idea to have Oznak's untranslated taunting of Daenerys in Low Valyrian use the dialogue from the French Taunter scene in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Linguist David J. Peterson confirmed this, though he modified a few words to match the scene (referring to Daenerys as the Dragon Queen and to Westeros). Peterson had to come up with Valyrian words for hamster and elderberry: the word for hamster is nýnyghi (which Peterson stated was inspired by the Knights Who Say Ni) and the word for elderberry is tomisto, from High Valyrian tōmītsos, a reference to Peterson's friend Tommy Lieber.http://www.dothraki.com/2014/05/the-valyrian-word-for-hamster/ Dothraki.com, David J.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Oznak zo Pahl is a noble from Meereen and a scion of the House of Pahl. He wields a 14-foot lance striped with the colors of his house (pink and white). It is rumored that he once cut the liver out of a man named Scarb who had looked at a Meereenese lady wrongly. Oznak claimed that he was defending the lady's honor, for Scarb had raped her with his eyes. No one dared to question Oznak's act since his uncle is the richest man in Meereen and his father commands the city guard.

Oznak is defeated by Strong Belwas instead of Daario Naharis, and the events play out slightly different. Daenerys chooses Belwas, a eunuch and former pit fighter, because he is the least important of her protectors, and because if Oznak should fall to such the Great Masters will be shamed, while if Belwas is defeated - it is a poor victory that Meereen can take no pride in. Belwas evades three of Oznak's charges before injuring his mount on the fourth, forcing him to fight on foot. He does not immediately kill the champion, as he allows his opponent to cut his belly once before finishing them off. He decapitates him, before defecating next to his corpse.
