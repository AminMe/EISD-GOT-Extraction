 Background 

 Loren Lannister was the last of the Lannister Kings of the Rock. When Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros, King Loren joined forces with Mern IX, the King of the Reach, to face Aegon in battle. 

However, Aegon unleashed his three dragons, Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion the Black Dread against the combined might of the Kingdoms of the Reach and the Rock. Four thousand men perished, consumed in a field of fire, including King Mern. Seeing he had no chance of victory, King Loren bent the knee to Aegon and gave up his crown. He was named Lord Paramount of the Westerlands and Warden of the West.\The Field of Fire (Complete Guide to Westeros)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-129815553456cca7729cae9 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /\House Lannister (Complete Guide to Westeros)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-129815553456cca7729cae9 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /\House Tyrell (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-129815553456cca7729cae9 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / In the books
