 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Wendel Manderly is the second son of Lord Wyman Manderly, the Lord of White Harbor and Warden of the White Knife. He is not quite as fat as his father and older brother, but is still considered immense. He is loud and boisterous, wears a large mustache and is bald. 

Wendel was killed in the book somewhat differently to the show: when the massacre started, he rose to his feet, but an arrow went in his open mouth and came out the back of his neck, killing him instantly. He did not have a chance to resist or surrender. 

Lord Wyman Manderly hates the Lannisters and the Freys for his son's death. He cannot act openly against them as long as his other son Wylis is held captive by the Lannisters, but he secretly plots to join Stannis and avenge Wendel's death. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
