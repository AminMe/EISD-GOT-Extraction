He's also known as Gelmarr the Grim and took part in the raid of Stony Shore, the assault on Winterfell and the hunt for Bran and Rickon. Alongside AggarandGynir Rednose, he took part in the abduction and killing of the children whose corpses were passed off as Bran's and Rickon's. He, Gelmarr, and Gynir were secretly killed at Theon's command, to prevent them from revealing the truth about the slain children. Farlen was falsely accused by Theon of the killing and was executed.
