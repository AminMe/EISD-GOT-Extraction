Rather than risk conflict, Aegon relented to his demands, and Maegor instead married Ceryse Hightower, the High Septon's niece. Their marriage proved childless, and after his father died he took a second wife. The Faith had barely tolerated Aegon's polygamous marriages due to his political power, but Maegor's polygamous marriage was so outrageous that Aenys had to exile him to the Free Cities to prevent war. Maegor was actually married to six wives during his lifetime, several of them women known to be fertile, but Maegor himself could not produce heirs. One of the women he married was named Jeyne Westerling. Three centuries later, <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Robb Stark","link":"Robb Stark","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Robb Stark]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-35467055656cca6864057f" href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> also married a woman named Jeyne Westerling (changed to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Talisa Maegyr","link":"Talisa Maegyr","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Talisa Maegyr]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-35467055656cca6864057f" href="/wiki/Talisa_Maegyr" title="Talisa Maegyr" class="mw-redirect">Talisa Maegyr</a> in the TV series), but she was just another woman from House Westerling, and it is a coincidence that one of her family members three hundred years earlier had the same name.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When the Faith Militant uprising broke out it soon overran King's Landing, causing Aenys to flee to Dragonstone, where he fell ill from the stress and died (some think Visenya poisoned him; he had become practically catatonic and unable to rule). Visenya fetched Maegor back from the Free Cities and he was crowned king on Dragonstone. Grand Maester Gawen was the only one to openly protest, pointing out that Aenys had <i>three</i> sons (Aegon, Viserys, and Jaehaerys) and by every inheritance law in Westeros, Maegor was behind them in line of succession. Maegor responded by beheading Gawen with a single swing of Blackfyre, and no one else spoke a word against him - many feeling that Aenys's young children could not handle the Faith Militant as Maegor could. He retook King's Landing, and riding Balerion led the royal armies to repeatedly crush the Faith's armies, though new ones kept arising as the rebellion dragged on throughout his reign. Aenys's son Aegon managed to rally some rebellious lords and even to ride his father's dragon Quicksilver. Maegor met them in the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye while riding Balerion, who killed both Aegon and Quicksilver. He also had young Viserys tortured to death, but Queen Alyssa and her son Jaehaerys fled. Maegor's increasingly brutal behavior, however, gradually disgusted more and more of his own former supporters.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">One of the steps that Maegor took to bring the revolt down decisively was enacting a set of laws that became known as "Maegor's law", forbidding Holy men from being able to bear arms.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Maegor eventually died on the Iron Throne in unknown circumstances: in some versions of the tale, he was murdered <i>by</i> the Iron Throne, while others suspect he was poisoned.

The most likely explanation held by historians is actually that Maegor committed suicide. At the end of his reign, Maegor's cruelty had finally caused most of the major lords of the realm to turn against him, rallying around Jaehaerys I. There was no civil war - all but a handful of Maegor's followers totally abandoned him to join the rebels, instead of fighting them. Only a handful of soldiers from local Houses remained to defend King's Landing as the rebel army approached. It is theorized that as Maegor sat despondently on the Iron Throne waiting for the approaching rebel army to take the city, he decided that he would rather die than face capture and torture, so he used the sharp blades of the Iron Throne to intentionally open his own veins and bleed to death.

Even so, while Aenys was too weak to rule, Maegor was far more brutal than he needed to be, gradually alienating all of the great lords of the realm. His cruel treatment of Aenys's children and of his own wives shocked the realm, and he was he was notoriously cruel to animals. Whatever the case, he became remembered as a controversial figure, commonly recalled as "Maegor the Cruel", and later generations of the Targaryen dynasty were tactful enough never to name one of their sons "Maegor" again, except for the mad Prince <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Aerion the Monstruous","link":"Aerion Targaryen","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion the Monstruous]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-35467055656cca6864057f" href="/wiki/Aerion_Targaryen" title="Aerion Targaryen">Aerion the Monstruous</a>.
