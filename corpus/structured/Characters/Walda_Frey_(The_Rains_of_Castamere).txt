 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, some of Lord Walder's descendants name their offspring Walder or Walda to incur Lord Walder's favor - a custom the Lord of the Crossing finds annoying. There's no mention of a daughter of Lord Walder named Walda, only granddaughters and great-granddaughters. See also (spoilers from the books) References
