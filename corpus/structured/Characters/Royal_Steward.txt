 Behind the scenes 

Robert Sterne is a casting director for the Game of Thrones TV series. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Royal Steward has a similar role, though his name, like in the show, is never mentioned. He greets Eddard when he arrives in King's Landing and summons him to the small council but rather than suggesting that he change he actually provides clothing for him. It is the steward rather than Renly Baratheon who summons Eddard after Robert's hunting accident in the books. As in the series he appears again to summon Eddard when Joffrey takes the throne. In the book it is a herald rather than the steward who announces Sansa to the court. References
