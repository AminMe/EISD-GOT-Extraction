</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Aenys was considered to be a weakling. He was as tall as his father but softer looking, slender and frail. He was very sickly as a child. His mother Rhaenys died when he was only three years old, which deeply traumatized him. He grew somewhat stronger and more confident after bonding to his dragon Quicksilver (progeny of the original three <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"dragons","link":"dragons","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[dragons]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/Dragons" title="Dragons">dragons</a> brought to Westeros during the Conquest). Like his mother, Aenys enjoyed court life and was a great patron of the arts: he was an intellectual, philosopher, and poet. He wore his hair long down to his shoulders, curled into ringlets and perfumed. He also had a thin silky moustache and beard, well-manicured to come to a fine point (described as a "Three Musketeers" look by Martin). He wore fine velvet robes with cloth-of-gold lining and an ermine collar, and wore gold rings and gemstones on his long, delicate fingers. He wore a large gold crown much bigger than his father's simple band of Valyrian steel interlaid with large square-cut rubies. Despite being a courtier in personality he was not very charismatic, possibly because others sensed how weak he was. Instead he had a nervous smile, as if anxious and eager to please those around him.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Aenys did not continue the Targaryen custom of <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"incest","link":"incest","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[incest]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/Incest" title="Incest">incestous</a> marriage. Instead, his father made him wed Alyssa Velaryon as a political marriage - though the Velaryons had intermarried with the Targaryens frequently, so they were still cousins to an unknown degree. Aegon I made the match because he wanted to assuage the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Faith of the Seven","link":"Faith of the Seven","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Faith of the Seven]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/Faith_of_the_Seven" title="Faith of the Seven">Faith of the Seven</a>, which considered incest to be a sin and always looked down on Aegon's polygamous marriage to both of his sisters as an abomination (though this was not without precedent in Valyrian culture). Aenys and Alyssa had three sons and two daughters, who in order were: Rhaena, Aegon, Viserys, Jaehaerys, and Alysanne. Their sixth and final child was a daughter named Vaella, but she died in the cradle.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">After Aegon I died of old age in 37 AL, Aenys I succeeded him as the second king of the unified Seven Kingdoms, when he was 30 years old.

He refused to use the obvious advantage of the Targaryen dragons. In contrast, Aenys's bloodthirsty half-brother Maegor was a great warrior, and crushed the rebellions that his older brother could no longer control. Very quickly, many came to see Maegor as the real power behind the throne.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">With Aegon I, Rhaenys, and Orys dead, Dowager Queen Visenya became the last of the Conquest-generation of Targaryens, and she did much to aid her son Maegor's rise in power.

</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Aenys's father had made him wed Alyssa Velaryon instead of continuing traditional Valyrian incestuous marriages, but Aenys himself wed his daughter and eldest child Rhaena to his eldest son Aegon. Perhaps Aenys rationalized that the Targaryens already had an incestuous bloodline and nothing they did would ever remove that, but actively embracing the custom with a new marriage soured relations with the Faith. Many considered it a political blunder.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Eventually, tensions with the Faith of the Seven boiled over. Maegor's first marriage to Cersei Hightower proved childless, and he could never hope to seize the throne if he could produce no heirs and was suspected to be infertile. Therefore, two years into Aenys's reign, Maegor entered into a polygamous second marriage to Alys Hightower. The Faith took this as a major affront, and this is what specifically sparked off the Faith Militant uprising. The <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"High Septon","link":"High Septon","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[High Septon]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/High_Septon" title="High Septon">High Septon</a> declared that the Targaryen brothers were monsters borne of incest, and all faithful worshipers of the Seven should rise up against them. The Faith's military orders, known as the Faith Militant, were deployed against the Iron Throne, forming the backbone of larger armies numbering in the thousands composed of faithful peasants and local lords who, pragmatically, were more concerned with throwing off Targaryen rule than whether their marriages were sinful. Aenys exiled Maegor for his second marriage, but this did not improve the situation: the Faith did not stop its uprising, while Maegor took Balerion with him to exile in <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Pentos","link":"Pentos","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Pentos]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/Pentos" title="Pentos">Pentos</a>, removing a major military asset which might have been used to help put down the rebellion.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The Faith Militant uprising spread across the realm during the remaining three years of Aenys's reign. Unable to deal with the crisis, he became became emotionally overwhelmed and relocated back to the privacy of Dragonstone. After some time he grew very sick, suffering from loose bowels and cramps, and his maesters could do nothing to help him. Visenya offered to help, but three days after her intervention Aenys died. Many suspect that Visenya poisoned Aenys. Barely an hour after Aenys's body was cremated, Visenya flew to Pentos on Vhagar to retrieve Maegor, who flew back with her to Westeros riding Balerion. Through as-yet unrevealed circumstances, upon his return Maegor claimed (many say "usurped") the throne ahead of Aenys's own children.

Construction continued through Aenys's reign, but the great castle would only be completed during Maegor's time on the throne. Their father Aegon I had ruled from the site of his landing for a time, but the ramshackle boomtown of wood and earth called "Aegonfort" judged to be unsuitable, and razed to the ground so the foundations of the larger city of King's Landing could be laid. In the meantime, Aegon had removed the royal court back to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Dragonstone","link":"Dragonstone (castle)","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Dragonstone (castle)|Dragonstone]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/Dragonstone_(castle)" title="Dragonstone (castle)">Dragonstone</a>, where he died after many years, though he always intended for the royal court to eventually return to the completed site of King' Landing. Visenya raised Maegor at Dragonstone, but Aegon frequently visited the construction site of King's Landing, and took Aenys with him.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">While Aenys had been a weak courtier whose attempts at negotiation were ignored, Maegor was a vicious tyrant, crushing the increasing rebellions against him. The Faith Militant uprising turned into a full-scale war during this time. An assassination attempt was made on the new king using <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"poison","link":"poison","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[poison]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/Poison" title="Poison">poison</a>, but Maegor survived, and after he recovered he promptly used Balerion to burn the entire King's Landing chapter of the Faith Militant to death (numbering several hundred men). Afterwards the High Septon organized armies to march openly against Maegor, and while Maegor was able to destroy their armies they would be replaced by new ones. Maegor ruled for only six years, but he quickly earned the nickname "Maegor the Cruel" (though as Aenys's Hand he had functionally ruled for five years before that)).
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Maegor's reign of terror particularly affected Queen Rhaenys's branch of the family. Due to a faulty bloodline caused by his incestuous parentage, Maegor could not produce living children, only deformed monsters who did not survive childbirth. In his pursuit to produce a healthy heir, he married eight or nine different women, several at the same time (becoming the only Targaryen after Aegon I who continued not only the Targaryen practice of incest, but of polygamy). He had several of his wives executed when they could not produce healthy heirs. After using up his first wife, who was Aenys's sister, he may have married Aenys's other sisters. He also married Tyanna of Pentos, Alys Halloway, and Jeyne Westerling. Aenys's eldest son Aegon led an uprising against Maegor, riding his father's dragon Quicksilver, and he clashed with Maegor's army (led by Maegor riding Balerion) in the great Battle Beneath the Gods Eye. Aegon was killed, his army was destroyed, and Balerion killed Quicksilver. Aegon had married his own sister Rhaena (rider of the dragon Dreamfyre) according to Targaryen custom, but now Maegor forcibly married Rhaena (his own half-niece) against her will, leading to her becoming known as his "Black Bride". Aegon and Rhaena had twin daughters but Maegor had them killed as well. Queen Visenya then died, and in the confusion Queen Alyssa managed to flee King's Landing with her two youngest children, Jaehaerys and Alysanne. In retaliation, Maegor had Aenys's middle son Viserys tortured to death, and his mutilated body left to rot in the courtyard of the Red Keep, in the hope that this would draw out Alyssa so she could plead that he be given a proper funeral. Alyssa, however, knew better than to reveal her whereabouts by this point.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Maegor eventually died on the Iron Throne in unknown circumstances: in some versions of the tale, he was murdered <i>by</i> the Iron Throne, while others suspect he was poisoned. As Maegor died without issue, he was succeeded by his nephew, Aenys's youngest son, who ascended the throne as King <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Jaehaerys I","link":"Jaehaerys I Targaryen","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/Jaehaerys_I_Targaryen" title="Jaehaerys I Targaryen">Jaehaerys I</a>. He married his sister Alysanne, and together they brought the Seven Kingdoms fifty years of peace. Thus all subsequent Targaryens, including <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Daenerys Targaryen","link":"Daenerys Targaryen","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Daenerys Targaryen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" href="/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a>, descend from Aenys and not Maegor.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">As for Aenys's name, George R.R. Martin made Targaryen dynasty names by mix-and-matching different name elements: "Ae-" in "Aegon", "Aemon", "Aemond", "Aerion", etc., and the suffix "-nys" from "Rhaenys" (less clearly, "Viserys" and "Daenerys"). In-universe, his name is apparently simply a combination of his parents' names: "Ae-gon" and "Rhae-nys" yielded "Ae-nys". It is pronounced like both elements in his parents' names: "AY-nis", but not "Ay-nus".<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/awoiaf.westeros.org\/index.php\/Pronunciation_guide AWOIAF Pronunciation Guide]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-1931151556cca708659f8" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />
