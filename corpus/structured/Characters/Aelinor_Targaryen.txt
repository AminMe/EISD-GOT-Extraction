 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aelinor is not mentioned precisely as Aerys I's sister-wife, though it was assumed by fandom she was a Targaryen due to the custom of dynastic incest. The prop of the Lineages book that Eddard reads in Season 1 of the TV series (written by Bryan Cogman) also made this assumpetion. 

In The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook, however, it is revealed that she was actually a member of House Penrose, a noble house from the Stormlands, as well as a cousin to House Targaryen. This information was only released in 2014, after Season 1. So far there has been no official update to her status in the TV continuity. See also (spoilers from the books) References
