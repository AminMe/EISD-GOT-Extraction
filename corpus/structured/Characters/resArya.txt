The Waif tells her that she has already tried playing the game but failed. She asks Arya who she is, to which Arya replies that she is no one. When the Waif is about to walk away, Arya asks her who she is. The Waif tells Arya a story about how she was the only daughter of a widowed Lord, who remarried, producing another daughter. Her stepmother, in order to secure her own daughterâs future, tried to poison her. The Waif found out about this and sought out the help of the Faceless Men to exact her revenge. The Waif then asks Arya whether she believed the story.

Before he leaves, he tells her that she is lying not only to him, but to herself as well when she says she hates the Hound. A grieving father brings his sick daughter to the House of Black and White, wanting to end her suffering. Arya tells the girl a false story about how she was sick too, but her father brought her here and when she drank from the temple's well, she was healed, persuading the girl to drink the poisoned water from the well.

Trant dismisses the first two and continues to hit the third girl, to no effect, so he punches her in the gut. Crumpled on the floor, the girl removes her face and reveals herself as Arya. She quickly stabs him in the eyes and several times in the chest, but her blade is too short and has little effect. She teases him about how he was the first name on her list and how the Many-Faced God has denied her of others, but how he has delivered Trant to her.

The Waif restrains Arya and Jaqen pulls out a vial of poison saying, "Only death can pay for life". Just before Arya thinks she is about to be poisoned, Jaqen drinks it himself and dies. The Waif questions Arya's grief for her friend, only to shock Arya by revealing herself to be Jaqen. Confused, Arya repeatedly removes multiple faces from "Jaqen's" body, until she sees her own face.

<p data-rte-fromparser="true">Despite her blindness, Arya continues to train under the Faceless Men, but has also turned to begging in order to survive.
</p>
<h2 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Personality</h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">Arya is a fiercely independent child who is unconstrained by social expectations like gender roles, courtly virtues, class distinctions, and the expectations of her parents and siblings. A tomboy, she never aspired to be a "proper lady" as her older sister Sansa did. Before the series of events that shatter her innocence and destroy her support system, Arya is full of life, and she makes others smile just by virtue of her spirited indifference to rules.Â 
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Once she begins the journey to King's Landing, however, she endures a constant stream of loss and trauma. As she watches her pet, sword instructor, friends, and family members taken from her one by one, she becomesÂ increasingly detached towards murder and death. This is only exacerbated when she is captured by the Hound and is exposed to his fatalistic worldview as they traverse the war-ravaged Riverlands, though the two develop a mutual reliance and almost grudging respect for each other. When she witnesses and learns of the betrayal and murder of her familyÂ at theÂ <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Red Wedding","link":"Red Wedding","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Red Wedding]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Red_Wedding" title="Red Wedding">Red Wedding</a>, she becomesÂ even more cold and driven to seek revenge on those who have wronged her and her family.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">While she is initially horrified when she accidentally stabs the stable boy in King's Landing during the betrayal of her father and his men, by the time she and the Hound have fled the massacre at the Twins, she is able toÂ kill without remorse and has accepted Syrio'sÂ belief that the only true god is Death. FollowingÂ Yoren's advice to her before he died, she has taken to listing off the names of each person she intends to kill each night before she sleeps.

<h2 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Behind the scenes</h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the novels, Arya is left-handed. Maisie Williams is right-handed, but plays Arya as left-handed to be true to the books, including learning how to fight with a sword in her left hand. Maisie's mother discovered that Arya is left-handed while reading the books, and urged her to play Arya left-handed, for fear that if she didn't, hardcore fans of the books would be outraged and instantly reject her performance.
</p>
<h2 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the books</h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the <i><a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"A Song of Ice and Fire","link":"A Song of Ice and Fire","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, Arya is nine years old when King Robert Baratheon arrives at Winterfell. She is a tomboy who wants to learn how to fight with a sword and ride horses, to the horror of her more demure older sister, Sansa, with whom she has a quarrelsome relationship. But she is encouraged by her half-brother Jon, to whom she is close. Sansa and Arya are so unalike that Sansa once asked their mother if her real sister was stolen by a grumpkin and Arya left in her place. Arya is the only one of the Starks' trueborn children who resembles their father in appearance - Jon Snow does, too, which once caused Arya to wonder whether she was also a bastard, but Jon assured her that she was not. Arya has Eddard's long face, which results in her being called Arya Horseface by her sister and her sister's friends. She is also known as Arya Underfoot by the Winterfell staff, as she is always curious and always where she isn't supposed to be. In the TV series, she is a good shot with a bow. In the novels, she does not know how to use a bow and isn't strong enough to even pull back the string, but wishes she could.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Yoren does not tell Arya the story about Willem and how he came to be part of the Night's Watch. Reciting the names of her enemies is something that she starts doing on her own. Yoren does tell her that her father was not supposed to die that day. The reason Yoren was in the Sept of Baelor and not already on the road is because he was told by <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Varys","link":"Varys","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Varys]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Varys" title="Varys">Varys</a>, the same man that came bringing Gendry, that Lord Eddard was to be given mercy, allowed to take the black, and would be traveling back with him to the Wall. When he says something must have gone wrong, Arya replies, "Joffrey. Someone should kill him."
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">During Season 2 of the TV series, she serves as Tywin Lannister's cupbearer. In the novels, she serves Roose Bolton, who captured Harrenhal from Amory Lorch after Tywin Lannister leaves with his army to defend the Westerlands. Thus, none of the scenes between Tywin and Arya happened in the books. She still flees from Harrenhal with Gendry and Hot Pie, but she does so without using Jaqen H'gar's help; though in the novels she does use Jaqen's help to open Harrenhal to Roose Bolton and the Northmen.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Arya's storyline at Harrenhal in Season 2 was heavily condensed from the books. After being captured by Ser Gregor Clegane's men, she is exposed to rape and murder on a regular basis. She is also abused and forced to work at Harrenhal, cleaning, serving men-at-arms at meals, and running errands for an under-steward name Weese, who beats her. When Jaqen H'ghar gives her the opportunity to kill three men, the first one she picks is a man-at-arms for Gregor Clegane named Chiswyck, because she overheard him telling a story, laughing about how he and Clegane's men had gang-raped an innkeeper's daughter. The second name she chooses is Weese. The TV series changed this so that instead, Arya chooses <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"the Tickler","link":"the Tickler","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[the Tickler]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/The_Tickler" title="The Tickler">the Tickler</a> and <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Amory Lorch","link":"Amory Lorch","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Amory Lorch]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Amory_Lorch" title="Amory Lorch">Amory Lorch</a>, who are not killed by Jaqen in the book.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Arya's third and final choice was similar, but somewhat condensed from what happened in the books. In the TV series, she asks Jaqen to help her escape, so he kills the Lannister guards. In the books, Arya asks Jaqen to help her free a large number of Northern prisoners-of-war who are being held at the castle. Jaqen refuses at first, then Arya chooses him as the third man to die. Jaqen asks her to change her choice, and she agrees on condition that he helps her free the prisoners. He enlists the help of <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Rorge","link":"Rorge","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Rorge]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Rorge" title="Rorge">Rorge</a> and <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Biter","link":"Biter","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Biter]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Biter" title="Biter">Biter</a>. They get large pots of boiling soup as the prisoners' dinner, but when they get to the dungeons, they throw the boiling-hot soup on the guards and slay them, free and arm the prisoners, and take Harrenhal from the Lannister forces. This is remembered as the "weasel soup" incident, because at the time, Arya was using the alias "Weasel" (naming herself after a little girl she took care of earlier in the book before being captured). Soon afterwards Jaqen leaves, after giving Arya the coin. He explains that if she ever needs to find him again, she should give the coin to any man from Braavos and say "valar morghulis".
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Roose Bolton becomes the master of Harrenhal as a result, and Arya becomes his <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"cupbearer","link":"cupbearer","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[cupbearer]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Cupbearer" title="Cupbearer">cupbearer</a>. Arya does not leave because she feels safe with the Northern soldiers, but at the same time she still keeps her true identity secret because she isn't sure if she can trust them yet. She overhears Roose and his men discussing the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"fall of Winterfell","link":"fall of Winterfell","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[fall of Winterfell]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Fall_of_Winterfell" title="Fall of Winterfell">fall of Winterfell</a> and Bran and Rickon's deaths, and refuses to believe the news. While Arya waits at Harrenhal in the hope that her brother Robb will eventually arrive (at which point she would reveal herself), she ultimately decides that she is not safe there and leaves with Gendry and Hot Pie, to try to reach her family at Riverrun.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Arya technically gained the title of "princess" when her brother Robb was declared the new <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"King in the North","link":"King in the North","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[King in the North]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/King_in_the_North" title="King in the North">King in the North</a>. While her brothers Bran and Rickon use the title of "prince" among the Northerners at Winterfell, Arya's storyline takes her on the run through the Riverlands as it is torn apart in the war between the Starks and Lannisters, so that she is usually keeping her true <i>name</i> a secret, let alone her title. Thus she normally isn't referred to as "princess", or at least not in her surroundings; Robb, Catelyn, and the Freys refer to her as a "princess" when brokering their marriage-alliance.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Ironically, she meets her Frey husband-to-be (<a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Elmar Frey","link":"Waldron Frey","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Waldron Frey|Elmar Frey]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Waldron_Frey" title="Waldron Frey">Elmar Frey</a>) while serving under Roose Bolton, and he spends time talking at length to Arya about his promised princess, unknowningly speaking to her personally. He tries to boss Arya around, but she does not comply. After being informed that Robb breached the pact with the Freys, Elmar tells Arya whiningly that his father told him he had to marry someone else, or to become a septon. Arya tries to empathize with him, telling him two of her brothers are dead. But when he responds derisively, she loses all sympathy for him.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the books there are no hints of romance between Arya and Gendry. In fact, Arya debates whether to kill Gendry once he discovers she is a girl, and the only reason she does not is that Gendry is armed and stronger than her. They become friends, and Arya considers him to be a part of her "pack". When he is taken prisoner by Gregor Clegane's men, she attempts to rescue him with Hot Pie, which leads to their group being taken prisoner by the Lannisters in the first place. The TV series didn't overtly play up a full-fledged "romance" between the two, though Gendry becomes one of Arya's few friends and, as in the novels, she is pained when he chooses to stay behind with the Brotherhood.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Arya's death list in the books is partially different than in the show, both the names, the manner by which some of they die, and their killers:

Killed by Jaqen H'ghar at Harrenhal.
</li></ul>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">Arya begins reciting the names of the first twelve people on her list while being taken to Harrenhal. Soon after she starts working there under Weese's supervision, she adds him, and this is the end of her list because he is beating her. Sometimes she says the phrase "Valar Morghulis", which she learned from Jaqen, along with her list. So far, four of the people are still alive, two (the Cleganes) are in uncertain status, and seven are confirmed dead. In the books, Melisandre never retrieved Gendry from the Brotherhood Without Banners, so the Red Woman, Beric, and Thoros aren't on the list. She also does not add "Walder Frey" to her list: rather, she states that she would have added "the Freys" to her list - any and all of them who took part in the Red Wedding - but she wasn't sure which ones specifically took part in it and which ones didn't.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Arya learns of Joffrey's death in the novels, she is not happy about it, not because she wasn't the one to kill him or watch as she wishes in the TV series, but because Joffrey's death doesn't matter as much since Robb was dead too. Also, in the novels, Arya and the Hound do not encounter Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne, nor do they encounter Rorge and Biter. The Hound is severely injured by Polliver and the Tickler during their fight at the inn, and eventually falls when his wounds fester. After this, Arya refuses to give him a merciful death, takes his silver, and leaves him to die on his own. She rides to the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Saltpans","link":"Saltpans","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Saltpans]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Saltpans" title="Saltpans">Saltpans</a> and searches for a ship that will take her to Jon at the Wall. All she can find is a ship headed to Braavos, which she boards using the coin Jaqen gave her. Once she arrives, Arya is escorted to the House of Black and White, where she searches for Jaqen and a safe place to stay. Instead of another man posing as Jaqen, she is greeted by a figure she can only identify as the "kindly man". The coin she presents gains her entry into initiation training with the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Faceless Men","link":"Faceless Men","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Faceless Men]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Faceless_Men" title="Faceless Men">Faceless Men</a>. During her first tasks, Arya struggles to abandon her previous identity, trying to use new names such as Cat of the Canals. Around this time, Arya recognizes a <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Night's Watch deserter","link":"Dareon","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Dareon|Night's Watch deserter]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Dareon" title="Dareon">Night's Watch deserter</a> by his black cloak, and kills him because he broke his vows and it is a law in the North to execute deserters. For this, she is given warm milk by the kindly man, and wakes up the next morning blind.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Meanwhile, in the North, <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Jeyne Poole","link":"Jeyne Poole","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Jeyne Poole]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Jeyne_Poole" title="Jeyne Poole">Jeyne Poole</a>, forced to pose as Arya, who is considered dead, is betrothed to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Ramsay Bolton","link":"Ramsay Bolton","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Ramsay Bolton]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton" title="Ramsay Bolton">Ramsay Bolton</a> in order to strengthen the Boltons' claim on the North. This political move brings some Northerners to their side in support of "Arya", while other Northerners joined Stannis Baratheon's forces in order to rescue her from them. The belief that his sister is being forced to marry Ramsay also torments Jon. Repeatedly, he tries to remind himself that as a member of the Night's Watch, he has cut off ties to his biological family. Initially, the only action he takes is through Melisandre, who helps him send <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Mance Rayder","link":"Mance Rayder","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Mance Rayder]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Mance_Rayder" title="Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</a> and a group of spearwives to save Arya. When Melisandre tells him that she has seen a vision of Arya traveling to the Wall on a dying horse to escape this marriage, Jon tries to prepare for how he will take care of Arya now. But the girl escaping her marriage turns out to be their distant relation Alys Karstark. The plan with Mance and the spearwives leads to Jeyne Poole's escape with Theon. In response, Ramsay sends a letter threatening Jon, demanding Arya's return, and claiming that Stannis is dead. This eventually leads to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"a mutiny against Jon","link":"Mutiny at Castle Black","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Mutiny at Castle Black|a mutiny against Jon]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Mutiny_at_Castle_Black" title="Mutiny at Castle Black">a mutiny against Jon</a> when he decides to leave Castle Black to rescue who he believes is Arya from the Boltons and confront Ramsay. The real Arya has no idea of those events.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The <i>World of Ice and Fire</i> source book released in 2014 revealed that Arya was named after Eddard's maternal grandmother, Arya Flint, from the northern mountain clans. The main novels did mention that Eddard's grandmother was from the mountain clans but didn't state her name. The "clans" have no connection to the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"hill tribes of the Vale","link":"Hill tribes","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Hill tribes|hill tribes of the Vale]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" href="/wiki/Hill_tribes" title="Hill tribes">hill tribes of the Vale</a> whom Tyrion encounters on the way from the Eyrie; they are minor Houses loyal to Winterfell who live in the northwestern highlands.

George R.R. Martin himself has pointed out that a surprisingly large number of people pronounce it incorrectly: it consists of two syllables, not three (like how the "aria" of an opera is pronounced). Martin explained: "I say it 'Are-ya', two syllables not three. Not 'are-ee-uh', not like an operatic thing, but 'Are-ya', very sharp. I wanted something that was like a knife, that was a sharp and hard sound, to be a contrast to the flowery 'Sansa'."<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/youtu.be\/DOEO27SZAtw?t=3m]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-213923693756cc95f1ef346" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />
