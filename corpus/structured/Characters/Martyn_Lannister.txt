 Season 3 

Martyn, along with his brother Willem, is captured by the forces of House Tully led by Edmure Tully following the Battle of Stone Mill. He is taken hostage and placed in a cell at Riverrun, the seat of the Tullys. 

After Robb Stark visits Riverrun to attend the funerals of Lord Hoster Tully, Martyn and Willem are visited in their cell by Queen Talisa Stark, who tends to Martyn's wounded hand while Willem looks in silence. Martyn asks if its true that Robb can turn into a wolf at night and devours the flesh of his enemies.\Walk of Punishment\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-102369101256cca60878710 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

Martyn and Willem are murdered inside their cells by Lord Rickard Karstark as vengeance for Jaime Lannister's killing of his son, Torrhen Karstark. Their bodies are presented to Robb, and as Rickard defends his actions as them being kin to Jaime, Robb furiously condemns this as saying they were innocent boys.\Kissed by Fire\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-102369101256cca60878710 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Family tree

 Behind the scenes 

Martyn is played by Dean-Charles Chapman, who would go on to be cast as Tommen Baratheon in the fourth season of the television series. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Martyn and Willem are the twin sons of Ser Kevan Lannister, and younger brothers of Lancel Lannister. Martyn is captured at the Battle of Oxcross. It is not Martyn but his cousin Tion Frey who is killed with Willem by Rickard Karstark. After Willem and Tion's death, Robb ordered to triple the guard on Martyn for his protection, and later exchanged him for a northman prisoner (Robett Glover). Martyn is not mentioned in the books afterwards. See also (spoilers from the books) References
