 Background 

Lyonel Baratheon was a member of House Baratheon of Storm's End, one of the Great Houses of Westeros, and rulers of the Stormlands. He took part in the Trial of Seven of Ser Duncan the Tall. Season 1 

He has an entry in the The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, as read by Eddard Stark.\A Golden Crown\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-29537191356cca77cd1403 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / In the books 

Lyonel Baratheon appears in The Hedge Knight, one of the stories in the Tales of Dunk and Egg series, which focuses on Ser Duncan the Tall and Aegon V Targaryen during Aegon's time as Ser Duncan's squire. Ser Lyonel is known as the Laughing Storm. He would often break into booming laughter the moment tourney rivals touched his shield, and laugh all the time he was mounting and charging and knocking them from their stirrups. If his challengers wore any sort of crest on their helm, Ser Lyonel would strike it off and fling it into the crowd. 

The entry for Lyonel in the Lineages book from Season 1 (see this image) says that he died at the age of 45, but this is unlikely, and possibly a case of the TV writers just filling in the gaps of knowledge for the prop book - in which case it is not strictly TV-canon. In the novels, he apparently died between 239 AL and 245 AL, and when he took part in Duncan's trial by seven in 209 AL he was already a large and powerful warrior. Assuming that Lyonel was at the very least 16 years old in 209 AL (like Duncan was, though he was probably older), he would have been born around 193 AL. Lyonel therefore could have been at most around 52 years old when he died - but from how he is presented in The Hedge Knight, he was apparently somewhat older than Duncan. More information may be filled in with future Tales of Dunk &amp; Egg novellas. See also (spoilers from the books) References
