 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Quent is a House Stark guardsman. He accompanies Bran and Robb to the Wolfswood during Bran's first ride since being crippled. After the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings, Quent marches south with the rest of the Northern force, and fights under the command of Hallis Mollen, the Winterfell captain of the guards after Jory Cassel's departure. Quent is one of the guardsmen ordered to accompany Ned Stark's remains to Winterfell after they are returned to Robb Stark as a gesture of goodwill by Tyrion Lannister. See also References
