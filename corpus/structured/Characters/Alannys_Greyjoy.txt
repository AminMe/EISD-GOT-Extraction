 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, her marriage to Lord Balon Greyjoy and the children they had remains the same except Yara is named Asha. Because the island of Harlaw is the wealthiest of the Iron Islands, House Harlaw is one of the few ironborn families that approach the Greyjoys in strength and influence. Shehas anoldersisterGwynesse, who was widowed by the Greyjoy Rebellion, and a younger brother LordRodrik Harlawknown as Rodrik the Reader. Her brother refersto her bythe pet name Lanny. 

Alannys was devastated by Theon being taken hostage and the deaths of her two eldest sons in the Greyjoy Rebellion, and began wandering the halls at night shrieking out their names. She had five ironbornboys brought to be fostered at Pyke afterNed Stark brought Theon to Winterfell including Tristifer Botley, a childhood love of Asha's. 

When herpsychosis worsened, she leftPyke to retire to the Ten Towers, her family's seat on the island of Harlaw. Thus she is not present at Pyke when Theon returns to see his father. Asha briefly visits her mother before leaving to conquer Deepwood Motte in her part in Balon's invasion of the North. During the visit Alannys constantly asks about Theon who she thinks of as perpetually ten years old, his age when he was taken hostage. Asha feels she no longer knows her mother though she is kind to her and answers her questions patiently. When Asha returns to the Iron Islands, she cannot bring herself to tell her mother Theon is dead (as Asha incorrectly presumes). Asha meets Tristifer Botley at Ten Towers who informs her thathe still only loves Asha.He has asked and received Alannys's consent to marry Asha though Asha rejects the proposal. 

Alannys has long white hair. She never had the sort of beauty the singers cherished, but her daughter had loved her fierce strong face and the laughter in her eyes, although Asha now finds Alannys's eyes dim and cloudy. See also References
