In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lord Whent's first is never given and comes from the companion book The World of Ice and Fire. 

Old Lord Whent hosted a great tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC, the Year of the False Spring. The tourney was held to honor his maiden daughter, who held the title of Queen of Love and Beauty when the tourney began. Her crown was defended by her four brothers and her uncle, Ser Oswell Whent of the Kingsguard. Prince Rhaegar Targaryen won the tourney and named Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty rather than his wife Princess Elia Martell, to the shock of all of Westeros. 

Ser Jorah Mormont states that he defended a Lord Whent at a tourney at Lannisport in 289 AC, though is unclear if this was Lord Walter or a descendant of his. See also References
