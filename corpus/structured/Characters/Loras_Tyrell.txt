Loras is seen going into Renly's tent, but it is not explicitly stated that they are lovers. However, <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"George R.R. Martin","link":"George R.R.

It isn't exactly clear how widely Renly's relationship with Loras was known about, or even to what extent their friends and family knew (Robert, Stannis, etc.) In the books, Littlefinger and Varys seem to know (due to their spy rings), and even Jaime Lannister makes an off-hand comment about it at one point. When directly asked how widely Renly's relationship with Loras was known about (citing that even Jaime knew), George R.R. Martin's only response was "what do you think?"<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/www.westeros.org\/Citadel\/SSM\/Entry\/A_Number_of_Questions\/ So Spake Martin]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">George R.R. Martin has pointed out in the behind-the-scenes featurettes for the TV series that as a youthful, attractive, and skilled tournament knight, Loras is essentially the "teen hearthrob" of Westeros, that all the young noble ladies in the Seven Kingdoms swoon over - as it is not publicly known that he is a homosexual.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Gregor Clegane is found to be terrorizing the Riverlands, Loras Tyrell volunteers to lead the forces that King's Hand, Eddard Stark, sends to bring him to justice, but Lord Eddard believing him too young says that Ser Loras would be after vengeance not justice (because Ser Gregor had tried to kill him at the Hand's Tournament), so he sends Beric Dondarrion instead. Varys tells Eddard that he should have sent Loras, because he was so keen to go and if you are going to make an enemy of the Lannisters it would be wise to make a friend of the Tyrells.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Renly declares himself king, he forms his own rival <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Kingsguard","link":"Kingsguard","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Kingsguard]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" href="/wiki/Kingsguard" title="Kingsguard">Kingsguard</a> which he calls the "Rainbow Guard", enjoying the opportunity to play with the pageantry of forming a new knightly order. The number seven is holy in in the Faith of the Seven, and rainbows are one of its symbols. This name change wasn't used in the TV series, where it is simply referred to as "Renly's Kingsguard". Each member of the Rainbow Guard represented a specific color (such as "Brienne the Blue" etc.), and wore armor and clothing that matched each color. Ser Loras was the Lord Commander of Renly's Rainbow Guard, and in this position he didn't represent a specific color like the other six members (therefore no one stood for indigo).
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Renly is murdered, Brienne does not kill Ser <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Robar Royce","link":"Robar Royce","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Robar Royce]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" href="/wiki/Robar_Royce" title="Robar Royce">Robar Royce</a> and Ser <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Emmon Cuy","link":"Emmon Cuy","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Emmon Cuy]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" href="/wiki/Emmon_Cuy" title="Emmon Cuy">Emmon Cuy</a>. They come into the tent and confront Brienne, Ser Emmon attacks her, but Catelyn swears to Ser Robar that Brienne is innocent. Ser Robar tells Catelyn to get Brienne away and he holds off Ser Emmon and some men at arms. When Loras arrives to find Renly dead, in his grief and rages he kills Ser Emmon and Ser Robar, for their failure to protect Renly and their allowing Brienne to escape. Later, he regrets doing this as they were his friends and he eventually realizes that Stannis, not Brienne, was responsible. In the series, Loras talks of blaming Brienne, but Margaery immediately points out that it is far more likely to be Stannis.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Loras does not wear Renly's armor in the Battle of the Blackwater in the book. It is his brother Garlan Tyrell who does this and who later asks Joffrey to take Margaery as his queen (Margaery still being in the Reach). Seeing him in Renly's armor many soldiers believed him to be Renly's ghost returned, and as they were once sworn to Renly they changed sides in the midst of the battle. When Joffrey asks Ser Loras what reward he desires for his part in the battle, Loras asks for a place on Joffrey's Kingsguard. This was primarily a calculated move so that Loras would always be on hand to protect Margaery from Joffrey. It also provided Loras with a convenient way to avoid marriage, something he had no taste for given his orientation and his grief.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Jaime and Brienne return to King's Landing, Loras and <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Meryn Trant","link":"Meryn Trant","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Meryn Trant]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" href="/wiki/Meryn_Trant" title="Meryn Trant">Meryn Trant</a> encounter them at the entrance to the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Red Keep","link":"Red Keep","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Red Keep]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" href="/wiki/Red_Keep" title="Red Keep">Red Keep</a>. Loras accuses Brienne of Renly's death and is ready to fight her. He does not believe her story about Stannis' shadow. Jaime intervenes and demands Loras to stop. Loras does not comply. Jaime grabs him and says harshly "Now sheathe your bloody sword, or I'll take it from you and shove it up some place even Renly never found." Loras obeys grudgingly. Later, Jaime talks with Loras and makes him realize that Brienne is innocent. In the TV series, Brienne visits not Loras, but Margaery, who believes her but advises her to keep quiet.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Jaime interviews Loras, the youth's arrogance and overconfidence makes him think <i>"He's me. I am speaking to myself, as I was, all cocksure arrogance and empty chivalry. This is what it does to you, to be too good too young"</i>. Jaime does not find the resemblance flattering, on the contrary.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Loras, who was not involved in <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"the conspiracy to murder Joffrey","link":"Purple Wedding","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Purple Wedding|the conspiracy to murder Joffrey]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" href="/wiki/Purple_Wedding" title="Purple Wedding">the conspiracy to murder Joffrey</a> (probably because of his rash nature), is certain that Sansa is the murderer, claiming that "My sister was drinking from that chalice as well. Sansa Stark was the only person in the hall who had reason to want Margaery dead, as well as the king. By poisoning the wedding cup, she could hope to kill both of them. And why did she run afterward, unless she was guilty?". Apparently, the fact that his sister was in danger makes Loras suspect the wrong person, as he wrongly suspected Brienne of killing the man he loved.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the books, Loras is left deeply mourning the loss of his great love Renly, and famously swears that he will never love again, saying "When the sun has set, no candle can replace it." Several critics including Westeros.org were upset that Loras has sex with <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Olyvar","link":"Olyvar","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Olyvar]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" href="/wiki/Olyvar" title="Olyvar">Olyvar</a> in "<a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Kissed by Fire","link":"Kissed by Fire","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Kissed by Fire]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" href="/wiki/Kissed_by_Fire" title="Kissed by Fire">Kissed by Fire</a>", because it seemed rather sudden, as if Renly's death did not deeply impact him.

However, Cogman explained, his earlier drafts of the episode actually included longer scenes which made it explicitly clear that Loras is <i>not</i> finished mourning Renly. Rather, Loras was very depressed and lonely, and in effect "drowning his sorrows" by engaging in casual sex in the hope that it would make himself feel better, but it ultimately made Loras feel more emotionally distraught and reminded of how much he misses Renly. Cogman lamented that "as we get closer to production a lot of trims have to be made and this scene was one where I had to do that," and he acknowledged that cutting the scene gave the unintended impression that Loras was moving past Renly, when he actually isn't.<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/www.westeros.org\/GoT\/Features\/Entry\/Season_3_Interview_Bryan_Cogman Westeros.org,] Season 3 Interview: Bryan Cogman.<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-70573405656cca5a62acdd" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />
