The Frey soldier partook in the Red Wedding. \The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-203571193856cca7a6a3228 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Season 3 

The soldier is first seen at a campfire with fellow Frey soldiers, mocking the death of Catelyn Stark and spreading stories on how he attached Grey Wind's head to Robb Stark's body. While one of the other men doesn't immediately believe this, saying that many of the Frey men would claim to have done the act, the soldier insists that with help from Malcolm and Talbot, he sewed Grey Wind's head onto Robb's body, mentioning how difficult it was to do so. 

Arya Stark, who passes the Freys along with Sandor Clegane, jumps off the horse and walks up to the Freys, engaging in a conversation. She asks for a meal, whereas one of the soldiers simply orders her to fuck off. Arya states that she is hungry, and the Frey soldier asks her what part of fuck off she doesn't understand. Arya claims to have money, showing the coin of Braavosthat Jaqen H'ghar gave her. 

The Frey soldier seems interested, reaching his hand out for the coin. Arya, however, drops the latter by 'accident' and apologizes. The soldier calls her a little shitand leans down to retrieve the coin. Before even grasping it, Arya pulls the man off of the wooden log and repeatedly stabs him in the neck. As the other Frey soldiers join the battle, Clegane intervenes and protects the Stark girl, eliminating each and every one of them as the stabbed Frey soldier bleeds profusely. 

After the battle is over, Sandor walks over to Arya, who is coldly staring down at the corpse of the Frey soldier she stabbed. He asks her if this was the first man she'd ever killed. After she confirms that it was the man\/i,link:Stableboy,wasblank:false,noforce:true,wikitext:Stableboy|first man data-rte-instance130814-203571193856cca7a6a3228 href/wiki/Stableboy titleStableboyfirst man, he asks where she retrieved the knife. She reveals that she pocketed it off of Clegane himself. Mildly annoyed, he grabs his knife back from her, and declares that the next time she plans on doing something like this, she should tell him first.

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the whole scene does not occur in the books. However, the trick with the coin Arya uses on the soldier is based on the way she tricks and kills a guard when she flees Harrenhal after the castle is seize by the Northern army led by Roose Bolton. Also, Arya stabs the Tickler multiple times, but that happens later in the book. References
