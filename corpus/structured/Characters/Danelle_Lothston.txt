Danelle Lothston was a Lady of Harrenhal and the head of House Lothston. She's also known as Mad Lady Lothston and is the stuff of tales and horror stories. 

According to tales, Mad Lady Lothston cooked children, which she captured by sending a giant bat - the sigil of House Lothston - out of the castle of Harrenhal, bathed in blood, and served feasts of human flesh.\Harrenhal (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-36630069356cca792f3af0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mad Danelle's backstory is the same. She ruled Harrenhal during the reign of Aerys I and was a loyal vassal of the Iron Throne. She had long red hair and wore tight-fitting black armor. 

The Lothstons held Harrenhal during the time of the Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel novellas, with Mad Lady Lothstonherself appearing in the third story in the series, The Mystery Knight​. Thus shemight appear in any potential adaptation of the prequels. 

The legends about Mad Lady Lothston bathing in the blood of slain children are loosely similar to the real-life seventeenth century Hungarian noblewoman Elizabeth Báthory. See also (spoilers from the books) References
