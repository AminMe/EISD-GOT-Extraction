In the books
In the Song of Ice and Fire novels, Gyles Rosby is the head of House Rosby, a noble house that rules over an eponymous town in the Crownlands. He's noted for being sickly and constantly coughing.

Lord Gyles is at many major events inclduing the Tourney on King Joffrey's Nameday, riot of King's Landing, Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister's wedding, the Battle of the Blackwater, the procession greeting Prince Oberyn Martell and Tywin Lannister's funeral. Cersei appointed him Master of Coin after Tyrion is put on trial for Joffrey's murder. Cersei considers him adequate in the position, but hounding over the crown's debt problems by the Iron Bank of Braavos' envoy exasperates his sickness and he perishes at the Red Keep. Grand Maester Pycelle protests that he did all he could, but an irate and paranoid Cersei accuses him of conspiring with Margaery Tyrell to kill Lord Gyles so a Tyrell can replace him. She orders Pycelle to have all Lord Gylesâ€™s lands and wealth go to Tommen rather than his ward. Cersei selects Ser Harys Swyft as the new Master of Coin.

According to the semi-canonical A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying Campaign Guide: A Game of Thrones Edition from Green Ronin Publishing Lord Gyles is the father of Lord Walder Frey's sixth wife Bethany Rosby and grandfather of Robb Stark's former squire Olyvar Frey and Lord Edmure Tully's wife Roslin Frey.
