==In the books==
In the ''[[Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Gyles Rosby is the head of House Rosby, a noble house that rules over an eponymous town in the Crownlands. He's noted for being sickly and constantly coughing.

Lord Gyles is at many major events inclduing the [[Tourney]] on King Joffrey's [[Nameday]], [[riot of King's Landing]], [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]]'s wedding, the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], the procession greeting Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] and [[Tywin Lannister]]'s funeral. Cersei appointed him [[Master of Coin]] after Tyrion is put on trial for Joffrey's murder. Cersei considers him adequate in the position, but hounding over the crown's debt problems by the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]]' envoy exasperates his sickness and he perishes at the [[Red Keep]]. Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] protests that he did all he could, but an irate and paranoid Cersei accuses him of conspiring with [[Margaery Tyrell]] to kill Lord Gyles so a Tyrell can replace him. She orders Pycelle to have all Lord Gyles’s lands and wealth go to [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] rather than his ward. Cersei selects Ser [[Harys Swyft]] as the new Master of Coin.

According to the semi-canonical ''A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying Campaign Guide: A Game of Thrones Edition'' from [[wikipedia:Green Ronin Publishing|Green Ronin Publishing]] Lord Gyles is the father of Lord [[Walder Frey]]'s sixth wife Bethany Rosby and grandfather of Robb Stark's former squire [[Olyvar Frey]] and Lord [[Edmure Tully]]'s wife [[Roslin Frey]].
