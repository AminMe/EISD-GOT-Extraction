Tom is seen looking out a window in the halls when he notices Mira walk by. Discreetly walking side by side, hoping to not look suspicious, Tom reveals to her that he found out Ludd Whitehill is sending a lot of gold to someone in King's Landing. Tom is suspicious of this and is convinced that Ludd is up to something - although he doesn't know what it could be. Tom suggests that Mira get herself into Tommen's coronation feast to speak to Lords Andros andMorgryn, the ironwood merchants hired by Lord Whitehill, in order to get more information. Tom makes his exit by warning Mira to be careful in her mission, saying that King's Landing tends to have it out for her.\Sons of Winter\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-205864602556cca689ee060 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / The Ice Dragon 

After Mira's dismissal from her service, Tom quickly informs Mira that she is now a person of interest by the guards after a rumor stated that she was luring men into her chambers to kill them. Tom also warns Mira that the guards are searching her room for evidence and the two try to discuss a plan to evade the guards. Soon, two guards appear, which prompts Tom to tell Mira to escape to a Collier store before he distracts the guards. 

After Mira's incarceration, she would be given two choices: marry Lord Morgryn and let the guards execute Tom in her place or let her face execution herself. In the event Mira agrees to the engagement, Tom is then seen in the executioner's block and begs Mira for help before he is decapitated after Mira is forced to give false testimony for Damien's murder. If Mira is executed instead, Tom is present in the crowd and watches her sadly. Appearances
