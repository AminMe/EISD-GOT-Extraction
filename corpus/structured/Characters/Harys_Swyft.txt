Ser Harys is present for a strategy meeting assembled by Lord Tywin Lannister following the defeat and capture of Ser Jaime Lannister in the Battle of the Whispering Wood. Also present are Tyrion Lannister, Ser Kevan Lannister, Lord Leo Lefford, Ser Addam Marbrand, and another bannerman, as well as Tywin's servants. Ser Harys remains quiet while the other bannermen discuss their next move. When Tywin grows exasperated and dismisses the council, Ser Harys departs along with everyone present, except for Tyrion, whom Tywin orders to stay.\Fire and Blood\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-31759572156cca72257343 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearance

The episode doesn't identify any of the bannermen present in the episode and their identities are conjectures based on lines spoken, age of the actor, costume and the overall blocking of the scene, all of them compared to the books. The only two unaccounted bannermen from the books are Ser Harys and Ser Flement Brax. As the latter is a younger character, second son of Lord Andros Brax, it is safe to assume the unidentified bannerman sitting next to Ser Kevan is meant to stand in for Harys Swyft In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Harys Swyft is present at the council following Jaime's capture and is the one who considers suing for peace. His lines are given to both Kevan Lannister and Leo Lefford. 

Tyrion Lannister dismisses Ser Harys as a shameless lickspittle whose only achievement is marrying off his daughter to Kevan Lannister. 

Cersei shares her brother's low opinion of Ser Harys, and once remarked that he should have adopted a worm as his personal sigil, as she considered a chicken (the emblematic animal of House Swyft) to be too brave a creature for him. 

Harys is with Tywin's army when they takeHarrenhal. During their time there he manages to alienate the cooks, who spit in his food. His squire is killed in an argument with theBrave Companionsover the supposed death of LordBeric Dondarrion.Arya watches him kissVargo Hoatunder Tywin's orders to make up and put the conflict behind them. 

During theBattle of the Blackwater, Harys is trapped beneath his horse after it falls on him, but is rescued by one of his men-at-arms. 

After Tywin's death, Cersei Lannister appoints Ser Harys as her puppet Hand of the King, instead of leaving the position vacant as in the show. Later, he is demoted to the position of Master of Coin and sent away to Braavos to negotiate the Crown's debt with the Iron Bank, a role taken by Mace Tyrell in the show. He is accompanied by several Lannister guards, one of them is Rafford (in the show he is replaced by Meryn Trant). See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
