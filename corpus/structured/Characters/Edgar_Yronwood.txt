<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In his youth, Prince Oberyn Martell was fostered by Lord Yronwood at <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Yronwood","link":"Yronwood","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Yronwood]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-120051200956cca80b8f0ce" href="/wiki/Yronwood" title="Yronwood">Yronwood</a>. When Oberyn was sixteen, he was found abed with Lord Edgar's mistress. Edgar challenged the prince to a duel, though only to first blood due to Oberyn's youth and high birth. Both men took cuts and honor was satisfied. However, while Prince Oberyn soon recovered, Edgar's wounds festered and he died. Afterward it was rumored that Oberyn had poisoned his sword, gaining his nickname of "The Red Viper".
