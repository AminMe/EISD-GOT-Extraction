The High Septon conducts the wedding of King Tommen to Margaery Tyrell. Some time later he visits Littlefinger's brothel, of which he's an recurrent patron, and engages in a sexual roleplay where the Father, a disguised Olyvar, rewards him by offering him one of six other members of the Seven to worship. The High Septon chooses a prostitute portraying the Maiden, which he seems to constantly pick, as well as one portraying the Stranger. As the two whores approach him, Lancel Lannister along other Sparrows break into the chamber, attacking Olyvar and scaring the prostitutes away. The High Septon is aghast by the attack, but he's soon stripped of his clothes and paraded as a sinner through the streets of King's Landing; with a sparrow beating his hands when the High Septon tries to cover his genitalia. Beaten and humiliated, the High Septon approaches the Small Council and demands the execution of the Sparrows, particularly their leader, citing that an attack on his person is an attack on the gods themselves. Qyburn reveals to the council where the High Septon had been attacked, to which the old man replies he had been preaching to the whores for their salvation. Queen Cersei has him thrown into the dungeons of the Red Keep.\High Sparrow (episode)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-209172852856cca635ce408 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the preceding High Septon was killed in the riot of King's Landing. Tyrion influences the Most Devout to choose this High Septon to replace him. Unlike his corrupt and fat predecessor, the new High Septon is considered to be a good man personally, but weak-willed, quietly obeying the Lannisters' political dictates. Tyrion scornfully describes the new High Septon as a trained seal who barks prettily on command. 

When a new High Septon assumes office, he renounces his given name and ever after becomes known simply as the High Septon, so the name of this particular High Septon, like those of his predecessors, is never revealed. 

Wary over him having been selected by Tyrion, Cersei has him killed by her agent Ser Osney Kettleblack, who suffocates him with a pillow. Cersei is also motivated by Lancel Lannister revealing to have confessed to him having bedded her and giving Robert Baratheon the more potent wine that led to his death. 

Cersei has this meek High Septon assassinated, instead of thrown into a cell. After the High Septon's death, it is Septon Ollidor of the Most Devout, considered one the most likely candidates to become his successor, who is followed into a brothel by the Sparrows and dragged naked into the streets, not this High Septon. They were condensed together in the TV version. In the novels, there was no particular mention that Septon Ollidor was having sex with prostitutes dressed up as the Seven (though he could have).
