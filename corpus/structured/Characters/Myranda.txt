Sansa boldly asks if Myranda ever really believed that Ramsay would marry her, which stops the girl dead in her tracks. Sansa coolly declares that she is a Stark and Winterfell is her home: she refuses to be scared and nothing Myranda says will intimidate her.

There are no women among them. Myranda was invented for the TV series, though she is <i>loosely</i> a condensed and gender-swapped equivalent to the Bastard's Boys. One of the oldest of the "Bastard's Boys" is "Ben Bones", the kennelmaster at the Dreadfort; Myranda is mentioned to be the kennelmaster's daughter, apparently a nod to the novels.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Ramsay doesn't really care about any of the Bastard's Boys, however, even when some die. At one point the one named Luton is grievously injured during a bloody brawl between the Freys and White Harbor knights invited to the wedding feast. Luton wails uncontrollably as he tries to hold his entrails inside himself with his hands, but the noise annoyed Ramsay so much that eventually he silenced him by ramming a spear into his chest (it wasn't a mercy-kill, he could have tried to get medical attention for Luton but didn't bother).

Apparently the actress who played Violet got pregnant and could not return to the show, but the original intention was to have Ramsay kill Violet with his hunting dogs - showing that, as with his own <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Master Torturer","link":"Master Torturer","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Master Torturer]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-80298422556cca5ae9a8a4" href="/wiki/Master_Torturer" title="Master Torturer">Master Torturer</a> whom he killed in Season 3, he really doesn't care about any of his underlings and will randomly kill them for flippant reasons. Because the actress could not reappear they had to use a new girl "Tansy" in the scene instead, lessening the point compared to killing Myranda's accomplice Violet.

Even in the episode he waves it off as if it was nothing she she brings it up. Ramsay doesn't really care about anyone, except his need for Roose's approval.

<p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Myranda, however, seems to have half-convinced herself that she's Ramsay's favorite on some level.
