 Season 1 

Ryger is present when Catelyn Stark visits Lord Walder Frey to negotiate passage for her son's army across the trident. Like his trueborn half-brother, Stevron Frey, Ryger admonishes his father to remember his courtesies. Lord Frey dismisses his son and reminds him that he's a bastard born of a milkmaid.\Baelor\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-150806296956cca6ef60bbf classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearance

 In the books 

The character's name is not given in Baelor, but his dialogue matches that of the character Ryger Rivers in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels. Catelyn's chapter in the first book in which she enters the Twins to request that Lord Walder grant Robb's army passage over the river was the only point that Ryger Rivers has appeared in the narrative so far. 

The dialogue in this scene matched the books fairly closely, describing Ryger as the bastard son of Walder and a woman who milked goats. He is described as being younger than Stevron Frey, who is 65 years old. See also (spoilers from the books) References
