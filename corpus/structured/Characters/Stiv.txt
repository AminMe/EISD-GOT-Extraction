 Background 

Stiv is a former member of the Night's Watch, who abandoned the Wall to live amongst the Free Folk. Season 1 

Stiv, Osha and Wallen flee south of the Wall, apparently in fear of the return of the White Walkers. In the woods near Winterfell they stumble across Bran Stark and decide to steal his horse. Realizing his importance, they ponder taking him prisoner and returning him to Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, for a reward, but decide against it. Robb Stark intervenes, and kills Wallen and disables Osha.Stiv holds a knife to Bran's throat, and despite Bran's protests not to, Robb lowers his sword as Stiv tells him to. However, Theon Greyjoy shoots him through the back with an arrow, killing him. Osha surrenders to Stark custody.\A Golden Crown\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-131981418156cca6d6cf3b3 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearance
