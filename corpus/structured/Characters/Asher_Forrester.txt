<p data-rte-fromparser="true">Asher, after entering Daenerys' tent, requests that he be given the Second Sons, however Daenerys is furious that Beskha, Malcolm and himself tried to harm Drogon but will eventually offer them a mission. Asher and Beskha must take Croft and go into Meereen to help liberate the city and uninstall the slave masters from its governing.

<p data-rte-fromparser="true">​​Asher returns with Beskha and Croft back to the Targaryen girl, with hopes that he will get his sellswords, but is denied by Daenerys, the reason being she and Croft still need them. Still, she is very thankful and gives Asher and Beskha a huge amount of gold if they did not kill the master or Asher reveals that Beskha was a slave, much to Beskha's dismay, to look somewhere else for the sellswords. However Daenerys still wants something; Malcolm. She likes his service and wants him to stay with her for a mission. Malcolm stays because he hopes that if she reclaims the Iron Throne, she would be a powerful ally to Ironrath.

</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Like expected, the Whitehills showed up and killed a lot of the killers and Rodrik's guards. While the fight is going on, a Whitehill soldier cuts down a plank and the Gate closes, leaving Rodrik and Asher alone with all Whitehills. When Gryff and his right hand man make an appearance, Asher and Rodrik try to open the gate, which won't be able to stay open for very long with only one of them holding it. Unfortunately, only one of them is able to escape. After a final argument, one of them decides to stay behind. If you choose Asher, he will have his last words to the almost crying Beskha, saying her new family are the Forresters now. He will fight while getting more and more injured, but be fatally hit in the chest by a crossbow. This leads the Whitehill men into grabbing Asher and stabbing him multiple times in the stomach. While in screaming pain, Gryff's right hand man punches Asher's eye out, and leaves him to die.<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>\"[[A Nest of Vipers]]\"<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-94963355656cca5ebc6f85" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />

<p data-rte-fromparser="true">If you chose Rodrik to sacrifice himself, Asher will escape instead.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Asher will order his men to stop down the road, and they stage an ambush for a group of Whitehill soldiers pursuing them. A dying Whitehill soldier will taunt Asher, and you can beat the soldier to death or leave him to die. Beshka will then talk to Asher about how she wishes she could have known Rodrik, and laugh with him about "how much of an ass his little brother can be."
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Upon returning to Ironrath, Asher takes up his father's greatsword and his role as Lord of House Forrester. His rule does not last long before Ludd Whitehill arrives with his army.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Whitehill comes up to the gate with Gryff and his general and announces that while he would love to kill every last Forrester, he is also willing to accept surrender. His terms are surprisingly generous. In exchange for surrendering, Ryon's return, and being allowed to live, the Forresters must swear fealty to him and be his bannermen. Asher would wed Gwyn to unite the two houses and Ludd would supervise the Ironwood business.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Given one hour to decide whether to surrender or die, Asher and his council decide to let Ludd think he's won and either ambush or poison him.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Gwyn talks to Asher shortly before the celebration of the Houses' peace terms and tries to convince him not to do anything rash, as she just wants both their families to live in peace. Afterwards, Duncan or Royland will ask if the attack plan is still on or if it is called off.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">If Asher chooses to keep the plan going, the situations differ depending on the method: ambush or poison. If it is an ambush, Asher will give the signal once Ludd is sitting at the head table and the warriors will attack. Gryff will be killed by Asher but Ludd escapes to the outside where he rallies his army, and proceeds to sack Ironrath.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">If poison is the method, Talia will pour Ludd his wine at the head table. Ludd will insist Asher drink from the same cup as him to symbolize the union of their houses. Elissa will then cut in and insist on drinking it with Ludd instead. If Asher lets her, both her and Ludd die, but Gryff escapes to the army and proceeds to sack Ironrath. If Asher does not let her, Ludd becomes suspicious and Asher's warriors attack. Ludd escapes to the army, Gryff is killed, and Ironrath is sacked.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">If either the ambush or poison plan is called off, Elissa will see that Duncan or Royland is signaling to cancel the plan. She will then get up from the head table abruptly, causing Ludd to be suspicious. Asher then gets up to reason with his mother, but Elissa insists he is allowing their house to be destroyed by cooperating with Ludd's peace terms and will then pull out a knife and attack Ludd. This causes the battle between both the Whitehill and Forrester soldiers to begin. Asher kills Gryff, then a Whitehill soldier stabs him, but Gwyn kills the man. She remains frozen, in shock over how badly things turned out. Asher pursues Ludd, however he escapes to his army and proceed to sack Ironrath.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Near the end of the battle, Asher is grievously wounded and his Sentinel, either Duncan or Royland, will put him on a horse and have him ride to safety. If the traitor was allowed to live by Rodrik, Talia will free the traitor and both of them find Asher. If the traitor was executed, it will be the Sentinel who finds Asher with Talia, or potentially Gwyn.

<h2 data-rte-spaces-before="1" data-rte-spaces-after="1" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1"> Personality </h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">Asher is described by most of his family as aggressive, impulsive, passionate and charming. But despite what most of his family may think of him, Asher is very good at thinking on his feet and is very resourceful. Despite Asher's hot-headed temperament, his uncle Malcolm felt that Asher has always been meant to lead men in battle. He is also quite the ladies man and a very skilled warrior, as he (with Beskha's aid) defeated a large number of Lost Legion soldiers, using his sword, axe, and unarmed combat. Asher is also known to be humorous and light-minded even in most intense and serious positions.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Asher also has a strong bond with Beskha, with her even referring to Asher as "little brother". Asher also became determined to return home once he learned of his father's and brother's murder, promising to kill Ramsay Snow.
