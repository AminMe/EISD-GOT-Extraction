Lysa Arryn, née Tully, is a recurring character in the first and fourth seasons. She is played by guest star Kate Dickie and debuted in The Wolf and the Lion. Lysawas the Lady Regent of the Vale, ruling on behalf of her young son Robin Arryn. She doted on her son and pursued a policy of isolationism following the death of her husband Jon Arryn. She presided over the trial of Tyrion Lannister for the attempted murder of Bran Stark. He proves his innocence in a trial by combat. Lysa refused to commit her forces to aid her sister Catelyn Stark in the War of the Five Kings. 

In reality, however, Lysa is one of the true orchestrators of the war, having conspired with Petyr Baelish, whom she is madly in love with, to assassinate Jon and frame the Lannisters in order to provoke a war between House Stark and House Lannister that devastates the Seven Kingdoms and leads to the deaths of thousands, among them her own sister and her nephew Robb Stark. Though Lysa technically betrays her own family by doing this, she is ultimately betrayed herself by Baelish, who pushes her out of the Moon Door and usurps her rule over the Vale once she is of no further use to him.

 Quotes 

 Behind the scenes Kate Dickie (Lysa Arryn) later said she hoped viewers were aware that she wasn't actually having Lino Facioli (Sweetrobin Arryn) suckle on her breasts, as Lysa disturbingly never weaned her son: she wore prosthetic breasts over her undergarments.http:\/\/watchersonthewall.com\/the-fall-of-lysa-arryn-an-interview-with-kate-dickie\/\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-71378552756cca5b593ca1 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / After being cast, Kate Dickie quickly read through the novels until the point when Lysa dies (at the end of the third novel, corresponding to Season 4). As a result, even in Season 1, Dickie was fully aware of Lysa's secret backstory, that it was really Lysa who poisoned her own husband Jon Arryn, and that she was allied with Littlefinger against both the Starks and the Lannisters. Dickie was therefore able to play her scenes in Season 1 knowing full well that Lysa was secretly lying to Catelyn.http:\/\/watchersonthewall.com\/the-fall-of-lysa-arryn-an-interview-with-kate-dickie\/\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-71378552756cca5b593ca1 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Ironically, given that her character Lysa lived in a mountaintop castle high above the clouds, Kate Dickie said she is actually very afraid of heights.http:\/\/watchersonthewall.com\/the-fall-of-lysa-arryn-an-interview-with-kate-dickie\/\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-71378552756cca5b593ca1 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In A Song of Ice and Fire, Lysa is Catelyn's sister, who is distrustful of the Lannisters. She dotes on her son excessively. In the books her son's name is Robert Arryn, but this was changed for the TV series to avoid confusion with Robert Baratheon and Robb Stark. Lysa married Lord Jon Arryn to tie three of the Houses involved in Robert's Rebellion - the Starks, Tullys, and Arryns - more closely together. Given the large age difference between her and Jon, their marriage was not a happy one. 

She is noted as overweight in the books, as a result of suffering two stillbirths and four miscarriages. The stress from these many pregnancies which ended in tragedy, combined with her distant relationship with her elderly husband, wore heavily on Lysa's mental state. This is also why she dotes so excessively on Sweetrobin, her only surviving child. 

In her youth, Lysa fell in love with Littlefinger, but her feelings were not reciprocated. One night Petyr tried to kiss Catelyn, and she rejected him, laughing. Petyr got drunk because of this, and Lysa climbed into his bed that night to give him comfort. Petyr took her virginity that night, telling her he loved her, but called her Cat before falling asleep. Lysa became pregnant with Petyr's child as a result of this.Her fatherforced her to abort the child instead, that he could marry her to Jon Arryn. The whole episode had great negative effect on Lysa's spirit. 

Lysa's marriage to Jon Arryn was very unhappy. She did not love the much older man she was forced to marry; she had five miscarriages, twice in the Eyrie and three at King's Landing; the only child who was born alive turned to be mentally and physically ill. 

During the War of the Five Kings, Robb Stark sent letters to Lysa, asking her to let his army pass through the Vale and provide ships at Gulltown to take them north. Had Lysa agreed, Robb could have landed at White Harbor, flanked Moat Cailin and driven the Ironmen from the north in half a year. But Lysa did not respond, and kept the Bloody Gate closed. 

When Lysa drags Sansa to the Moon Door, she blurts out the whole truth about her first pregnancy, the abortion, and Jon Arryn's death. The singer Marillion is present when Lysa struggles with Sansa (and he sings loudly to drown out Sansa's screams). Littlefinger appears and consoles her before telling her he only ever loved Catelyn (in the books, he says only Cat instead of your sister), shocking Lysa so much that when Littlefinger pushes her out she does not even scream but continues to look at him in disbelief as she falls. Littlefinger blames the murder on Marillion, who confesses after being tortured by Mord. Since the singer is despised throughout the Vale for his mocking songs and obnoxious behavior, the Vale bannermen readily believe his guilt. 

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, Lysa Arryn is pronounced LIE-ssa AIR-in, as opposed to Liss-ah or Lee-suh. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
