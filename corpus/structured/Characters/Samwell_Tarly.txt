However, Randyll felt that a Tarly joining the non-martial Maesters would still be a massive embarrassment to the military reputation of their House. Because Randyll was horrified at the prospect of a member of House Tarly ever wearing a Maester's chain, he instead sent Sam off to join the Night's Watch, where at least in theory he would be defending the realm from the dangers beyond the Wall. Ironically, the officers at Castle Black decide that the best use for Sam at the Wall is to serve as an aide to the blind old Maester <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Aemon","link":"Aemon","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Aemon]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-164372568956cca5bb35aef" href="/wiki/Aemon" title="Aemon">Aemon</a>, given that many of their recruits are starving peasant boys or criminals who can't even read, and Sam is not only literate but quite well-read. Sam gains some small respite from his suffering at the Wall when he discovers that Maester Aemon's library at Castle Black contains thousands of books collected by the Watch over the millennia, many of them extremely rare (even a well-stocked library such as at Winterfell normally only contains several hundred books).
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the book, Sam's encounter with the White Walker is different in the show: it takes place during the retreat from the Fist of the First Men.

Sam hates that nickname, even though it is better than "Ser Piggy", because he does not feel he deserves it. He keeps asking people not to call him that, but for no avail.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The thing that attacks Sam and Gilly is not an Other but a wight. Although Sam is scared, he is determined to protect Gilly, and fights valiantly against the wight. Both the dragonglass and steel daggers are useless against the wight, but Sam destroys it by shoving a burning stick into its mouth.

Following the funeral, Gilly and Sam grow intimate and have sex for the first time. Afterwards Sam is filled with guilt, not only for breaking his vows: he loves Gilly but is forbidden of marrying her; he believes she deserves a better man, not a big fat coward like him; and cannot bear the thought of hurting her feelings by taking advantage of her and later leaving her (in sharp contrast to Theon Greyjoy, who used a <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"captain's daughter","link":"captain's daughter","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[captain's daughter]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-164372568956cca5bb35aef" href="/wiki/Captain's_daughter" title="Captain's daughter">captain's daughter</a> for sex and then dumped her without second thought). The captain's daughter, however, poses him an ultimatum: either he goes to bed with Gilly, or will be thrown overboard. Defeated, Sam goes to Gilly and tells her he would like to marry her, would prefer her for any princess or highborn lady, but is bound by his vows. Gilly wipes his tears and tells him "The trees watch over us. In the forest, they see all. but there are no trees here. Only water, Sam. Only water".
