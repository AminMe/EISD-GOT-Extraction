Melisandre asks Davos if he loves his wife to which he replies he does. She asserts that he answers that way yet he has known other women and Davos tells her not to talk about his wife anymore.

After rescuing Davos, Salladhor Saan advises him to return to Marya so he can comfort her following their son's death, but Davos demands to be taken to Dragonstone to stop Melisandre. Salladhor agrees but jokes that, after Davos is killed, he will gather his bones so that Marya can wear them around her neck.} data-rte-instance130814-158130692056cca69952fc0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Family tree 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Marya is the daughter of a common carpenter. She has seven sons with Davos: Dale, Allard, Matthos, Marc, Devan, Stannis (named after the king), and Steffon. While Davos went with Stannis' household to Dragonstone, Marya remained at the family keep in Cape Wrath to raise their two youngest sons. Of Marya's other five sons, only Devan survived after the Battle of Blackwater. 

Marya is described as good-natured, plump woman with sagging breasts and a kindly smile. See also References
