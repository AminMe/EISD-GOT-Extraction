</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">He suffers from a severe case of gout, which mostly prevents him from walking and restricts him to a wheelchair.<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>\"[[The Lion and the Rose]]\"<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Unlike his more hotheaded and aggressive brother, Oberyn, Doran is a pensive, calculating, and patient man who always waits and observes before making his next move. Despite their different personalities, the two brothers were very close. While Oberyn could indulge in the wayward Dornish ways, challenging whomever he liked regardless of the consequences, Doran was raised to be more responsible as the heir to the Dornish throne. He truly cares for both his people and his family, and would never make a decision that would go against their interests. However, this is often against their wishes.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Doran has also been a witness to war and was deeply marked by its consequences. As such, he often tries to find a solution that avoids waging war, even if the honor of House Martell has been offended. This, along with his physical weakness, gives some people the impression that he is weak-willed and can be easily dominated, but this is misleading; Doran is just as ruthless and decisive as any other member of House Martell. He's simply better at hiding it - until the moment that he strikes. <img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[[The Dance of Dragons|''The Dance of Dragons'']]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />

<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the <i><a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"A Song of Ice and Fire","link":"A Song of Ice and Fire","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, Prince Doran is a cautious, pensive man who does not wear his emotions on his sleeve. He weighs the consequences of every action before he makes them, but whatever action he ultimately takes is therefore very deliberate. Tywin Lannister himself warns that Doran's patience and insistence on long-term planning should not be mistaken for indecision or laziness, and considers him a genuine threat.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Doran was the eldest child and heir of his mother, who by the equal primogeniture laws of the Dornish ruled as Princess of Dorne in her own right. It is unknown what noble House his father was from. He had two younger brothers who died in infancy, and his two younger siblings Elia and Oberyn were born a decade after he was (Elia nine years later, and Oberyn a year after that). As a result of their age difference Doran was raised alone, which probably reinforced his tendency to not share his thoughts, though he deeply loved both Elia and Oberyn (similar to how <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Robb Stark","link":"Robb Stark","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Robb Stark]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" href="/wiki/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb Stark</a> and <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Rickon Stark","link":"Rickon Stark","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Rickon Stark]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" href="/wiki/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon Stark</a> were born ten years apart, but still cared greatly for each other).
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Doran has three children: Princess Arianne, Prince Quentyn, and Prince Trystane, all born of his wife, Lady Mellario of <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Norvos","link":"Norvos","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Norvos]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" href="/wiki/Norvos" title="Norvos">Norvos</a>. Doran married Mellario for love, not as an arranged marriage; however, the two of them later fell out of love, and Mellario moved back to Norvos.

Even so, Oberyn was so infuriated by the atrocity of Elia's death that he urged that Dorne should continue the fighting with the aim of placing <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Viserys Targaryen","link":"Viserys III Targaryen","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Viserys III Targaryen|Viserys Targaryen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" href="/wiki/Viserys_III_Targaryen" title="Viserys III Targaryen" class="mw-redirect">Viserys Targaryen</a>Â on the Iron Throne. Doran, however, would have none of it, recognizing that Dorne was in no position to resist the combined power of the victorious rebel armies. Relations with the Iron Throne were deeply soured and it was only through extensive negotiations with the new Hand of the King, <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Jon Arryn","link":"Jon Arryn","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Jon Arryn]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" href="/wiki/Jon_Arryn" title="Jon Arryn">Jon Arryn</a>, that Dorne remained loyal to the Iron Throne - but the Martells completely withdrew from the royal court (explaining why they don't prominently appear in the novels before Joffrey's wedding - the middle of the third novel/beginning of the fourth TV season).
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">At the time of the War of the Five Kings, Doran has a bad case of gout and has trouble walking, preferring to move in a wheeled chair constructed by his maester. He hides his disability so as to not appear weak to his potential enemies. Instead, while still in command of his wits, Doran has semi-retired to the Water Gardens palace, and delegated much of the day-to-day running of Dorne to Oberyn. Doran went about using canes for a time, but he had to switch to using a wheelchair about two years before he first appears in <i>A Feast for Crows</i> (which would make it around the time the war started).
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Doran's gout is bad enough that he cannot walk more than a few steps, but he is not a complete invalid, and thus he could have come to King Joffrey's wedding if he truly wanted to, travelling by ship or palanquin. His physical condition was just bad enough, however, to make a convenient excuse for not having to go to King's Landing - enough that the Lannisters couldn't overtly express their displeasure that he did not come. His maester administers him <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"milk of the poppy","link":"Milk of the poppy","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Milk of the poppy|milk of the poppy]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-107556061856cca5c451dae" href="/wiki/Milk_of_the_poppy" title="Milk of the poppy">milk of the poppy</a> regularly to dull his pains, but he does not take it on occasions when he needs his head clear, in which he bears the pain silently.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Doran's brother Oberyn takes his place and goes to King's Landing. In the novels the agreement was slightly different: to secure the neutrality of Dorne in the war, the Lannisters betrothed Cersei's daughter Myrcella to Doran's son Trystane, but also offered Doran a seat on the Small Council. Oberyn arrives instead and takes the Small Council seat (simply as an advisor without a specific office). The TV series condensed this somewhat (because the agreement was last mentioned two full seasons before and viewers may have forgotten) to simply say that Doran was supposed to come to Joffrey's wedding, though Oberyn took his place - and then <i>after</i> Joffrey died, Tywin gave Oberyn a seat on the Small Council to try to keep Dorne loyal to the Lannisters. The overall effect is minimal: either way, Oberyn ended up arriving in King's Landing soon before Joffrey's wedding, and wasn't heavily involved in the Small Council before Joffrey's death.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Doran is aware that many of his subjects, nobles and commoners alike, demand to avenge his brother and think he is too meek and weak and cautious, too lenient to their enemies, while they would have welcomed open war with the Lannisters. The Sand Snakes tell him that to his face, comparing him to their father. Obara claims that if Oberyn was alive and Doran was dead, Oberyn would have not waited even one moment before leading his banners north, and the spears would have been raining on the marches. Doran, however, does not yield to the public pressure. He believes in what his mother taught him many years ago: that only madmen fight wars they cannot win; that valor is a poor substitute for numbers; and it is an easy thing for a prince to call the spears, but in the end, the children pay the price. For their sake, the wise prince will wage no war without good cause, nor any war he cannot hope to win.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">After hearing the plans that the Sand Snakes have in store to avenge their father, Doran orders to imprison them, to make sure they do not ignite a war. Afterwards, he warns Ser Arys Oakheart that there are many Dornish who may try to kill Myrcella as a payback, and invites him to bring Myrcella to the Water Gardens. He does not, however, order to imprison his daughter Arianne, what almost turns to be a fatal mistake: she concludes that her father wants to keep Myrcella away not from those who wish to harm her, but from those whoâd seek to <em data-rte-washtml="1">crown</em> her. She attempts to execute Tyene's plan to crown Myrcella, and by that to provoke the Lannisters into war. Arianne and her escorts are intercepted by Aero Hotah, but Ser Gerold Dayne (aka Darkstar) slashes at Myrcella and escapes. Myrcella survives but is horribly injured. In the aftermath, Doran reveals that he has in fact been plotting Tywin Lannister's downfall since Robert's Rebellion: he initially intended to betrothe Arianne to Viserys, but after his death at Khal Drogo's hands, he has sent his son, Quentyn, to Meereen to offer Dorne's support to Daenerys Targaryen (though Daenerys is forced to flee Meereen on Drogon, and Quentyn dies while trying to capture Rhaegal and Viserion). He sends Arianne, Obara, Tyene and Nymeria on seperate missions as part of his revenge against the Lannisters.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The TV series pronounces "Doran" as "Doh-RAN", two distinct syllables with the emphasis on the second one, as opposed to "DOOR-un" with the emphasis on the first syllable - that would sound too much like "Dorne", the kingdom he rules over.
