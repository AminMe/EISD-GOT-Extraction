Ser Addam is present for a strategy meeting with Tywin following the defeat in the Battle of the Whispering Wood by the main portion of the Stark army. Also present are Tyrion Lannister, Kevan Lannister, Leo Lefford, Harys Swyft and another bannerman, as well as Tywin's servant and several Lannister officers. He asks about Stannis and Renly Baratheon, and Kevan confirms that both Baratheon brothers have declared against the Lannisters. Later he dismisses suing for a truce so as to not appear weak, and proposes that they march against the Starks instead. Tywin dismisses his bannermen and then announces plans to relocate to Harrenhal.\Fire and Blood\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-17426863456cca6f4f3e4f classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearance 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Addam Marbrand is the most aggressive of the Lannister bannermen at the meeting and decries the idea of a truce. However, Marbrand is the same age as Ser Jaime Lannister and has long red hair and wears a smoke grey cape. 

During his youth, Addam was a page at Casterly Rock and a childhood friend of Jaime Lannister. 

Ser Addam is one of Tywin's bannermen present at Harrenhal and departs the ruined castle a day before his liege lord. He survives the Battle of the Fords and joins Tywin in the march south when the latter receives word of Stannis Baratheon's imminent attack. After the Battle of the Blackwater, Addam is made Commander of the City Watch. 

After Jaime returns to King's Landing, he practices with Addam for a while, but fearing that Addam may get drunk and reveal what poor fighter Jaime is now, he moves to practice with Ilyn Payne. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
