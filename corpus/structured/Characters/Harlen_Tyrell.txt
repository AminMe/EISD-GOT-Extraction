Harlen Tyrell is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is not expected to appear, being long dead by the time it begins. 

Harlen was the steward of Highgarden during the reign of King Mern IX of the Reach. After the death of his king in the Field of Fire, Harlen surrendered Highgarden to Aegon the Conqueror. Afterward, Aegon elevated Harlen to Lord Paramount of the Reach and Warden of the South and House Tyrell to the status of a Great House.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/highgarden\/ HBO viewers guide entry on Highgarden\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-128449721756cca7448a6a0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /\House Tyrell (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-128449721756cca7448a6a0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

According toOlenna Tyrell, Harlen was like most Tyrell men and grew up banging steel too loudly for thought to penetrate, like his descendants Luthor, Mace, and Loras. She also implies that it was Harlen's wife who came up with the idea to surrender to Aegon and convinced Harlen to go along with it.\The Reach (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-128449721756cca7448a6a0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books
