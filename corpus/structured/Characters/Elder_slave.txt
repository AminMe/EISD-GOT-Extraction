 Season 4 

He is one of the older slaves in Meereen and has experienced two slaves revolts.

They are, however, persuaded by Grey Worm and take up arms against their masters.\Oathkeeper\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-158343337556cca7ed5091b classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances
