Willem is an unseen character mentioned by Yoren in What is Dead May Never Die. He is described as being very handsome and one the ladies like.

History
Background
Willem, for unknown reasons, killed Yoren's older brother and fled town that night. From then on, Yoren&nbsp;started to become obsessed&nbsp;with him, thinking about him whenever he did anything, going as far as to&nbsp;whisper&nbsp;his name every night before going to bed. Willem returned to his hometown years later and Yoren says he buried an axe so deep into Willem's skull they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse took Yoren to the Wall.
