</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">However, Brynden refused to take part in the marriage, saying at the time that he would not simply be told when and whom to marry. From Hoster's point of view, many Tullys in past generations had been asked to do their duty for the good of the House and enter into arranged marriages to secure powerful alliances: even Brynden did not deny that it was a good match, but nonetheless refused to further the fortunes of his family. This led to a severe argument between the two brothers that would last much of the rest of their lives. Hoster called Brynden the "black goat" of the Tully herd, but considering their family's <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"heraldry","link":"heraldry","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[heraldry]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-95820270856cca7027fbe4" href="/wiki/Heraldry" title="Heraldry">heraldry</a> of a silver trout, Brynden joked that it would be more apt to say he was the black fish of the Tully school - the nickname stuck with Brynden ever since, and he even took a black trout as his personal sigil.

It isn't clear if Bethany is Olenna's sister or a more distant cousin.

</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Had Brynden agreed to the marriage-alliance with House Redwyne, it would have drastically altered Robert's Rebellion by giving the rebels access to the large fleet of House Redwyne, but given that he didn't, the war was decided entirely on land. Indeed, while the Tyrells and the rest of the Reach actively fought on the Royalist side in the war, it is stated that the Redwynes were among the staunchest Targaryen loyalists.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Hoster came up with several alternate marriage-alliance proposals over the years, all of them admittedly quite good matches, but Brynden refused them all, adding to the bickering between the two brothers.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Brynden never said exactly why he refused to marry Bethany Redwyne (or anyone else since), leading to much fan speculation:
</p>
<ul data-rte-empty-lines-before="1"><li>Brynden might simply have been insulted at the idea of being pressured to marry against his will.
</li><li>Brynden may have loved another woman he could not have, and thus refused to love any other.

</li><li>Brynden may be homosexual, but refuses to discuss this publicly. Then again, even homosexuals such as <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Renly Baratheon","link":"Renly Baratheon","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Renly Baratheon]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-95820270856cca7027fbe4" href="/wiki/Renly_Baratheon" title="Renly Baratheon">Renly Baratheon</a> would enter into loveless marriage-alliances if it furthered their political needs.
