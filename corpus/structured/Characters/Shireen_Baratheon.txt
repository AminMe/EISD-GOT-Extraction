Grateful of his gift, Shireen thanks Davos and sends him off with a heartfelt goodbye. Stannis later visits Shireen and the two discuss the events that unfolded between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her brother Aegon during the Dance of the Dragons. Stannis tells her if a man knows what he is and remains true to his self that he must fulfill his destiny no matter how much he hates it. Shireen, being the loving daughter she is, expresses to him that she wants to help and will do whatever she can to help her father -- without knowing his true intentions. As Shireen embraces her father, Stannis asks for her forgiveness.

<p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Even after deciding to introduce Shireen in Season 3, the producers still weren't sure if they would be able to include her in future seasons due to time constraints. Ingram was therefore only initially signed on to play Shireen for one year. After Season 3 finished, however, the writers felt that Ingram's performance turned out well enough, and Shireen was well-received enough, to merit devoting screen time to her again, so Ingram was called back to continue playing the role. As Ingram noted, in her first two seasons on the show she really only interacted with three other people, one at a time, each in Shireen's chamber: Stannis, Davos, and Melisandre.

In the books, this means that her hair color is outright black, but in the TV series it is a lighter shade closer to dark brown. This might be due to the fact that actress Kerry Ingram has naturally light hair, and it was decided that dyeing her hair completely black looked too artificial. This is similar to how <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Tyrion Lannister","link":"Tyrion Lannister","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Tyrion Lannister]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister" title="Tyrion Lannister">Tyrion Lannister</a> in the books has the same golden-blonde hair as his siblings, but because actor <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Peter Dinklage","link":"Peter Dinklage","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Peter Dinklage]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Peter_Dinklage" title="Peter Dinklage">Peter Dinklage</a> has black hair in real life, dyeing it to this color didn't match the actor very well, so the makeup team soon switched Tyrion's hair color in the TV series to more of a dirty blonde (Tyrion's original golden-blonde hair can be briefly glimpsed in a few scenes in the first episode of the series).

<h2 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the books</h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the <i><a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"A Song of Ice and Fire","link":"A Song of Ice and Fire","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, Shireen is the daughter of Stannis Baratheon and Selyse Florent. She is described as a sad, sweet, and gentle child, far from pretty. She inherited the unattractive features of both the Baratheons and Florents: the square jutting jaw of her father, and the large ears of her mother. When she was an infant she contracted the dreaded disease known as Greyscale, which is usually fatal. It nearly killed her, but she survived, however it horribly disfigured her: it left a swath of flesh on her left cheek and neck visibly dead, grey and flaking. As a result - and possibly also her parents' relatively unloving marriage - she became a sullen and quiet girl, withdrawn around all except for the castle's court jester Patchface and her cousin Edric Storm.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Shireen was not born a princess, though she was born into a powerful noble family. When she first appears in the Prologue of the second novel, Maester <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Cressen","link":"Cressen","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Cressen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Cressen" title="Cressen">Cressen</a> thinks to himself that the castle staff have only recently begun referring to her as "princess" - ever since Stannis declared himself king as Robert's lawful heir. He notes, however, that everyone, including Shireen, picked up the new title very quickly.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Because her uncle Renly died without issue, and her uncle King Robert died without any legitimate children (only <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"bastards","link":"Bastard","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Bastard|bastards]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Bastard" title="Bastard" class="mw-redirect">bastards</a>), Shireen is the only remaining legitimate Baratheon heir, after her father Stannis. Robert did have one acknowledged bastard, Edric Storm, but he has been cut from the TV series (parts of his storyline, such as being taken to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Dragonstone","link":"Dragonstone","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Dragonstone]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Dragonstone" title="Dragonstone" class="mw-redirect">Dragonstone</a>, were assumed by Robert's other bastard son <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Gendry","link":"Gendry","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Gendry]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Gendry" title="Gendry">Gendry</a>). Robert had several other unacknowledged bastards (i.e. Gendry) but they would be considered even further behind in the line of succession, if at all.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Shireen, like her father, has some Targaryen blood. <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Steffon Baratheon","link":"Steffon Baratheon","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Steffon Baratheon]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Steffon_Baratheon" title="Steffon Baratheon">Steffon Baratheon</a> who was father to Robert, Stannis, and Renly, was the son of King Aerys II Targaryen's aunt, Rhaelle Targaryen, and thus he was Aerys's first cousin. Robert, Stannis, and Renly are actually second cousins to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Rhaegar Targaryen","link":"Rhaegar Targaryen","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Rhaegar Targaryen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Rhaegar_Targaryen" title="Rhaegar Targaryen">Rhaegar Targaryen</a> as well as <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Daenerys Targaryen","link":"Daenerys Targaryen","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Daenerys Targaryen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" title="Daenerys Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a>. Thus Shireen is the second cousin once removed of Daenerys. This might be moved around somewhat in the TV continuity, which removed Aerys II's father Jaehaerys II, who had a brief rule and died young - to simplify his relationship with <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Aemon Targaryen","link":"Aemon Targaryen","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Aemon Targaryen]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Aemon_Targaryen" title="Aemon Targaryen" class="mw-redirect">Aemon Targaryen</a>.

Shireen might have inherited some of these abilities, as she mentions that she frequently has dreams about dragons (despite having never seen a live one), though this might just be because she is an imaginative little girl who grew up in a castle filled with dragon-shaped statues and gargoyles.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Stannis's relationship with Shireen is ambiguous. Certainly, he is as distant from his family as he is from everyone else around him. Stannis is also somewhat troubled that he has no male heir to carry on the Baratheon dynasty - which is a serious concern in the male-line inheritance system of the Seven Kingdoms, as there are those who would opportunistically challenge succession through a daughter. On the other hand, Stannis has remarked in the books that should he ever die in the war, he expects his soldiers to keep fighting to put Shireen on the throne.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Indeed, once Stannis realized that his wife would bear him no new children and Shireen was his only heir, he sought to ensure that she be properly educated to rule in her own right someday. Most girls in noble families of the Seven Kingdoms are given an education that primarily focuses on being groomed to be a wife and mother to a major lord, i.e. learning how to sew, sing, pray, and curtsey (they are also taught mathematics, because a lord's wife is expected to administer his household). Stannis, however, ordered Shireen's instructors to focus on matters relating to good governance: geography, history, religion, and classical literature have been specifically mentioned as topics she studies, and she is an avid reader. In many ways, Shireen is receiving a more thorough education than Catelyn Tully or Cersei Lannister did. After Robert died, this only increased her father's determination that Shireen should be prepared to be a Ruling Queen. This is in complete contrast with how Cersei indulged Joffrey and ignored his education, resulting (or contributing) to him becoming a dangerously incompetent ruler.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The TV series's official description of Shireen describes her as escaping her lonely life through stories in books. Shireen isn't described as a shy bookworm type in the books, however this is in keeping with how the books describe her as withdrawn and lonely. Shireen isn't a POV character in the books and hasn't received much focus so far, so the TV series is rounding out her character much as it did characters in Season 2 who weren't POV characters in those parts of the books, such as <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Margaery Tyrell","link":"Margaery Tyrell","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Margaery Tyrell]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Margaery_Tyrell" title="Margaery Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</a>.

<p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Shireen's death is thus the first <i>major</i> spoiler even for book readers. The only other thing that has been somewhat of a spoiler so far is the appearance of the White Walker leader and revelation that <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Craster","link":"Craster","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Craster]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Craster" title="Craster">Craster</a>'s sons are indeed being turned into new White Walkers, back in Season 4's "<a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Oathkeeper","link":"Oathkeeper","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Oathkeeper]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Oathkeeper" title="Oathkeeper">Oathkeeper</a>" - but it was <i>implied</i> that this was happening, and presumably the White Walkers would have some kind of leader. The burning of Shireen, however, is the first major character death confirmed to take place in an unpublished novel.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the novels, Stannis actually left Shireen, Selyse, and Melisandre at Castle Black with Jon Snow. The basic idea that Shireen is burned as a sacrifice seems to have been moved around somewhat from how it will play out in the novels. In the books, Melisandre <i>is</i> still insistent on burning a sacrifice of royal blood (to the point that before his death Jon fears that she might want to burn Maester <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Aemon","link":"Aemon","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Aemon]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Aemon" title="Aemon">Aemon</a>, because he is a Targaryen and specifically the son of a ruling king). It is <i>very strongly</i> implied that Stannis and Melisandre might burn Shireen as a sacrifice in the future - but in the upcoming apocalyptic war against the White Walkers, not so the blizzard halting his march against the Boltons at Winterfell will cease. When he marches to Winterfell Stannis actually instructs the men he leaves behind that if he dies in the assault, he expects them to keep fighting to put Shireen on the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Iron Throne","link":"Iron Throne","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Iron Throne]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="/wiki/Iron_Throne" title="Iron Throne">Iron Throne</a>. Fundamentally, however, Martin confirmed to Benioff and Weiss that in some form Melisandre is going to burn Shireen alive as a sacrifice to the Lord of Light in a future novel.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Shireen's death seems to be based on the Greek myth of <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Iphigenia","link":"Wikipedia:Iphigenia","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Wikipedia:Iphigenia|Iphigenia]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-82109975356cca5a859465" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a> during the Trojan War. Her father King Agamemnon needed to lead the combined Greek fleet to Troy, but the winds were against them and the fleet remained stuck on the coast in Greece. Unable to fulfill their oaths to attack Troy, the seer Calchas tells Agamemnon that the only way to appease the gods so that they will calm the winds and let the fleet leave is if he sacrifices the life of his daughter Iphigenia. Agamemnon is at first horrified, but under pressure from the other Greek captains he reluctantly agrees. Like Shireen, Iphigenia is unaware of her imminent sacrifice until the last moment, when she is brought before the altar.
