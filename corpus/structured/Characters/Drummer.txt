 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the musicians at the Red Wedding are noted to be terrible, however this is due to the fact that they are actually sellswords and crossbowmen in disguise. 

Based on Lothar's comment to Talisa in the TV series, the musicians are a group of assassins who developed musical talent to avoid suspicion, hence it cost the Freys a lot of gold to hire them. References
