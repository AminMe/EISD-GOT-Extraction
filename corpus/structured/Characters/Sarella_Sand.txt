Sarella Sand is the fourth of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the Sand Snakes. Season 4 

Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to Queen Cersei Lannister.\First of His Name\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-47289532456cca645b5a6a classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Family Tree 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Sarella is Oberyn's daughter whom he fathered on a ship captain from the Summer Islands. Her mother is the captain of the Feathered Kiss. 

Sarella has her mother's looks of dark brown skin, curly black hair, and black eyes, though like all the Sand Snakes she has her father's widow's peak and the same shape to her eyes. 

She is nearly twenty years old, and has a reputation for insatiable curiosity and pushing in where she didnâ€™t belong. While Obara and Nymeria inherited their father's martial prowess, and Tyene his skill with poisons, Sarella inherited Oberyn's keen intellect. 

Sarella has not appeared yet on the novels, only mentioned. After Prince Doran hears what Obara, Nymeria and Tyene have in mind to avenge their father, he says that he hopes Sarella shows more common sense than her sisters. 

Sarella hasn't been identified by name in the TV series, though Oberyn did mention that he had eight daughters, just as in the novels, which indicates that she probably also exists in the TV continuity, even if she has not yet been featured. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
