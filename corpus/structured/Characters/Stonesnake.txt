They pick up his tracks but are ambushed by wildlings. Harker, Stonesnake and Borba are killed while Qhorin is captured. Jon had spared the captive and she leads him into a similar ambush. Jon blames himself for their deaths, and Qhorin tells him to make sure it wasn't in vain. Qhorin seizes the opportunity to insert Jon as an infiltrator in the wildling ranks by berating him for the deaths of the others publicly.\The Prince of Winterfell\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-67581660356cca73b75b08 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances 

 In the books 

In the Song of Ice and Fire novels, Stonesnake is also a Ranger serving under Qhorin Halfhand. He is short and wiry man, near fifty with a grey beard. He is stronger than he looks, and has the best night-eyes of anyone Jon has ever known. He's dubbed Stonesnake for his ability for climbing mountains and cliffs. 

Stonesnake leads the mission to scale the Skirling Pass at night to ambush a trio of wildling watchers. He and Jon kill two of the sentries (one of them is Orell). He expresses distrust in Ygritte and later informs Qhorin of what she told Jon. 

In the novels, his fate is uncertain. After his horse panics and breaks its leg, he offers to stay behind and fight the pursuing wildlings like Dalbridge, but Qhorin orders him to make it through the Frostfangs afoot to the Fist, and to tell Mormont what they saw. Jon watches asStonesnake goes away, and fears that he has no chance. Stonesnake has not been mentioned since. While it has not been confirmed that he died, according to the novels appendix he was lost afoot in the Skirling Pass. See also (major spoilers from the books) References
