 Background 

He is a general loyal to House Baratheon of Dragonstone, serving Stannis Baratheon's army in his campaign to retake the North from House Bolton. Season 5 

Following Ramsay Bolton's attack on the camp, Stannis orders him to put the guards who were on watch duty in chains and question them to find out if they fell asleep or conspired with the enemy, and then hang them. He is later present during Shireen Baratheon's sacrifice. He looks visibly distressed as he watches her burn alive.\The Dance of Dragons\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-111019793156cca694898e0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

Later, he informs Stannis that nearly half of his army has deserted him, including all the sellswords and horses. He stands behind Stannis as they discover Selyse Baratheon's swaying corpse beneath a tree where she hanged herself. The General then tells Stannis that Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
