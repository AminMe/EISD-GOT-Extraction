A prostitute disguised as the Stranger is an unnamed minor character in the fifth season. She is played by Samantha McEwan and appears in High Sparrow. Biography 

 Season 5 

This whore disguises herself as the Stranger of the Faith of the Seven for a sexual roleplay to the High Septon, a recurring client of Littlefinger's brothel. Because the Stranger is traditionally depicted in art with its face obscured, she wears her hair down over her face as part of her costume. She is chosen for worship but is scared away seconds later when a group of Sparrows breaks into the establishment to seize the head of the Faith.\High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-82084054856cca73308ba4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances 

 Behind the scenes 

Samantha Bentley played two other prostitutes in Season 4 and Season 5, but they are not the same characters. Indeed, within High Sparrow she played both the whore dressed up as the Stranger in King's Landing, and hundreds of miles away, the whore dressed up as Daenerys Targaryen in Volantis (her face was obscured by her costume when she played the Stranger, so it was easy to have her appear twice without anyone noticing).
