 Season 5 

He and his comrade hunt for Tyrion Lannister when a price is placed on his head. They mistake another dwarf for Tyrion and kill him, bring his head before Queen Cersei Lannister. She reveals that the head is not Tyrion's, and Ser Meryn Trant accuses them of trying to deceive their queen and offers to throw them in a cell. Cersei advises against it, as she does not wish to disuade the other hunters. Both men thank her for her mercy and she orders them to take the head with them, before Qyburn suggests that he keep the head as it may be useful for his work.\The House of Black and White\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-25431301056cca7fe42e0a classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearance 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cersei is presented with the head of a different dwarf, whom Brienne met on the road in the Riverlands. 

Many other dwarf heads are also presented to Cersei off-screen, however, one of which is indeed from one of the dwarfs who performed at the Purple Wedding. The actor-dwarf's name is Oppo. He is killed by sailors from Westeros who spot him in Volantis and mistake him for Tyrion. References
