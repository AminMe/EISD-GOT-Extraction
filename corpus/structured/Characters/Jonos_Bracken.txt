Lord Jonos Bracken, having presumably joined Robb Stark's army after the victory at the Battle of the Whispering Wood, advocates joining forces with Renly Baratheon. Robb points out that Renly is the late King Robert's youngest brother and he cannot become king before Stannis. Bracken asks if Robb means to join Stannis instead. Jon Umber then suggests they become independent altogether, and declares Robb as the King in the North. Bracken and the other lords present, even the river lords who have never been ruled from Winterfell, draw their swords and swear fealty to Robb as the King in the North.\Fire and Blood\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-207866623356cca6d285d67 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearance 

 In the books 

In A Song of Ice and Fire, Jonos Bracken is the ruling lord of House Bracken and its castle, Stone Hedge. He is a loyal bannerman to Lord Hoster. However, he has an enmity towards House Blackwood, part of an old feud going back a thousand years and which continues to cause unrest in the Riverlands. 

Lord Jonos has fathered five daughters: Barbara, Jayne, Catelyn, Bess, and Alysanne, but no trueborn sons, leading some to question his masculinity. Although he claims Harry Rivers - The Bastard of Bracken - as his natural born son, there are those who doubt whether Jonos truly sired the boy, as Harry is fair haired and handsome, and Jonos is neither.
