<h2 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the books</h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"<i>A Song of Ice and Fire<\/i>","link":"A Song of Ice and Fire","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[A Song of Ice and Fire|''A Song of Ice and Fire'']]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-87990236756cca6471a48a" href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire"><i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i></a> novels, an Unsullied by the name of Stalwart Shield takes the role of White Rat. Whereas Grey Worm and others chose to keep his demeaning Unsullied name to defiantly reappropriate it from the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Good Masters","link":"Good Masters","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Good Masters]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-87990236756cca6471a48a" href="/wiki/Good_Masters" title="Good Masters">Good Masters</a>, some of the other Unsullied, however - those who were born into slavery and don't remember their original names - do take up the suggestion to make new dignified names for themselves, such as "Stalwart Shield".
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The TV series may have thought this would take too long to explain, so they renamed the character "White Rat" to keep with the previously established thematic naming of the Unsullied ("Grey Worm", "Red Flea", etc.)
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Stalwart Shield is the first (and not the last, as Ser Barristan warned) of Daenerys's soldiers who is killed by the Sons of the Harpy. Till then, they limited their attacks to unarmed freedmen.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Like in the show, Stalwart Shield was attacked at a brothel, but was killed in a different manner: he was stabbed multiple times, then the killers filled his throat with goat genitals (Grey Worm removed them before the body was brought to Daenerys). As always, the killers left their mark in the crime scene - a harpy drawn in the blood of their victim. From the look of Stalwart Shield's wounds, Ser Barristan Selmy estimated that there were at least six attackers, and since his scabbard was empty - that he might have injured some of his murderers. Daenerys ordered her servants to conduct an investigation, but the murderers were not caught.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When his body was brought before Daenerys, she asked Grey Worm why he was in a brothel. Grey Worm answered: "Even those whoÂ lack a man's parts may still haveÂ aÂ man's heart." In the series, it is Missandei who pursues this line of questioning, and it is framed in the context of her feelings for him.
