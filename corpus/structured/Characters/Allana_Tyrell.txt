She is the cousin of Margaery Tyrell. Biography 

 Background 

Allana is a member of House Tyrell. Season 3 

Allana is mentioned by her cousin Margaery while chatting with Sansa Stark. According to Margaery, when she was 12, she was very clumsy and Allana looked like a goddess sent to torture her. Allana used to call Margaery Pig-face, and whenever she passed Margaery in the halls, she'd oink, so Margaery prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. Margaery tells Sansa that a week after that, Allana came down with porridge plague. Only when Margaery bursts out laughing, Sansa understands it is a joke. Sansa asks what has become of Allana, and Margaery answers that she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. Margaery finds this very frustrating, but Sansa assures her that Allana must be very jealous of her, now that she is going to become a queen. \And Now His Watch is Ended\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-3582270856cca71b3b441 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books
