In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Victarion is Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet, his flagship is Iron Victory. He is a fierce warrior and capable commander in battle, though otherwise he is not very intelligent. Outside of combat he has a calm demeanor, thinking of enemies with great respect. He is a religious man and wears full plate armor while sailing because he has no fear of drowning. He believes it is honorable to kill a foe, but shameful to humiliate a captive. 

In his childhood, Victarion was often made fun of by his brothers Euron and Aeron. Their mockery often came disguised as praise, and sometimes Victarion had not even realized he was being mocked, but until he heard the laughter, then he'd explode in rage. As a result, he has grown to be humorless person that mistrusts laughter. The sound of it always leaves him with the uneasy feeling that he is the butt of some jape he does not understand. 

Victarionhas claimed many victories, and was defeated only once by Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of Fair Isle during the Greyjoy Rebellion. 

Victarion has been married three times, none of which produced any children. His first wife died giving birth to a stillborn daughter. His second wife died from a pox. 

Several years ago, Euron seduced - perhaps raped - and impregnated Victarion's third wife, which drove Victarion to beat her to death so he would not be put to shame as a cuckold. Only the taboo against kinslaying kept Victarion from killing Euron too, or rather, Victarion was so enraged that he would have killed Euron, but Balon would not have kinslaying within their family, so he made Victarion grudgingly promise not to harm Euron. As a punishment, Balon exiled Euron from the Iron Islands. Victarion deeply hates Euron ever since and wishes him dead. 

For a ship captain, Victarion is surprisingly ignorant in geography: he thinks that the Dothraki Sea is actually a sea. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
