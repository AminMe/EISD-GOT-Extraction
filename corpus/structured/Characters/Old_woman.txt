 In the books 

In the novels there is no equivalent scene or character. However, the phrase the North remembers is common among certain Northern nobles who were left reeling by the betrayals House Stark and the North suffered, even those who felt slighted by the Starks (Lady Dustin) or have allied with the Boltons resent House Frey for the relatives and men lost during at the Red Wedding. In the novels, the level of involvement of the Boltons in the Red Wedding is not common knowledge, though it is suspected by several prominent characters. 

None of the servants in Winterfell offered to help Jeyne Poole (who was replaced in the show by Sansa), either because they did not care or too afraid from the Boltons. Few of them even were direct members of the Stark household - Ramsay killed most of them when be burned Winterfell originally, except for a few women he took back as prisoners to the Dreadfort.
