However, he is also regarded as an unsavory character and his relationship with his daughters is regarded as sordid. The Night's Watch grudgingly has to tolerate this, as he is one of their few sources of information and shelter beyond the Wall.

Jeor intervenes to apologize on Jon's behalf. Craster warns Jon against talking to his daughters. Jeor agrees to follow Craster’s rules while they are his guests and orders Jon to sit down and keep quiet. Craster asks if they brought wine and Jeor says that they did before questioning him about the abandoned villages they have passed. Craster insists on wine before answering and Jeor sends a man to fetch a cask of Dornish wine from their supplies. Jon looks around at Craster’s numerous daughter-wives on the upper level of the hall.

<h2 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the books</h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the <i><a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"A Song of Ice and Fire","link":"A Song of Ice and Fire","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-133934710956cca5dc456ee" href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, Craster is a powerfully built, imposing man whose strength is starting to give way to the ravages of age. He has grey hair, a drooping mouth, a flat nose, and has lost one ear to the cold.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">According to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Ygritte","link":"Ygritte","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Ygritte]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-133934710956cca5dc456ee" href="/wiki/Ygritte" title="Ygritte">Ygritte</a>, Craster is the son of a ranger of the Night's Watch by a wildling woman from <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"White Tree","link":"White Tree","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[White Tree]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-133934710956cca5dc456ee" href="/wiki/White_Tree" title="White Tree">White Tree</a>. After the ranger slept with the woman and got her pregnant, he abandoned her and returned to the Wall. She came to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Castle Black","link":"Castle Black","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Castle Black]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-133934710956cca5dc456ee" href="/wiki/Castle_Black" title="Castle Black">Castle Black</a> and attempted to give Craster to the Watch when he was a child, but was driven off by the rangers instead.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The ranger Dywen describes Craster as "kinslayer, liar, raper and craven" which is quite accurate description. He is regarded as an ally - if a somewhat uncertain one - by the Watch. Unlike most wildlings, he lets them shelter in his home and gives them information. His help has saved many rangers' lives. Despite his reputation, Craster considers himself a godly and generous man.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Although Craster is a wildling, the other wildlings mistrust and despise him for marrying his own daughters, which is considered a taboo even among the wildlings. Ygritte disdainfully told Jon that "Craster's more your kind than ours. Craster's blood is black, and he bears a heavy curse".
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Mormont is fully aware of Craster's vile deeds. He loathes Craster and would not mourn him if any of his wives kills him - but regards him as necessary evil, because there were times Craster's Keep made the difference between life and death for the rangers of the Watch.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Craster has a total of nineteen "wives", ranging from Ferny, an old woman, to younger ones like Gilly. The names of two other wives, Nella and Dyah, are mentioned in the books. Most if not all of his current wives are also his daughters.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the TV series, Craster boasts that he has had 99 sons by his many daughter-wives, which is probably an empty bragging; he has sacrificed all of them to the White Walkers. Gilly's son is his 100th son. The books never gave an exact number for how many sons he had.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the book, it was not Karl but Dirk who killed Craster, by slitting his throat.
