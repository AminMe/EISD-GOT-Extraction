The Hound says she is decent company, and Polliver tries to convince him to join them in raping, robbing and pillaging; they have free reign to do as they wish, since they are wearing the King's colors and no one is standing in his way as the war is over. Sandor's blunt response is "fuck the King". Offended, Polliver mentions the hearsay about the Hound running from the Battle of the Blackwater and how he originally didn't believe it. The Hound mocks this and demands a chicken.

Polliver says no, but that they are the king's men, and again asks if he has money. The Hound says no but still demands the chicken. Polliver presents him a deal: one of their chickens in exchange for raping Arya, mentioning that his friend <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Lowell","link":"Lowell","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Lowell]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-194543156356cca6261f837" href="/wiki/Lowell" title="Lowell">Lowell</a> "likes them a bit broken in." The Hound calls him a talker, and that talkers make him thirsty, and proceeds to lift Polliver's drink and chug it down. He says that they also make him hungry, and now demands two chickens. Polliver glances back at his men-at-arms seriously, and tells the Hound that he doesn't understand the situation. The Hound says that he understands that if Polliver keeps talking, he will have to eat every chicken in the room. Polliver says that he lived his life for the king, and asks if he is willing to die for some chickens, but the Hound says "someone is." The tension finally erupts into conflict, and Polliver is knocked out of the fight by the Hound who throws a table over him. After moments of fighting several of Polliver's men-at-arms, Polliver reaches for his sword but is stopped by the Hound, who steps on it and punches Polliver. The Hound then proceeds to slaughter all but Polliver and two of his men, whom Arya staggers by smashing a pot over his head and then kills him by slowly sinking his own longsword into him, and the Hound kills the other by stabbing him in the chest.

A look of recognition comes over Polliver's face as he finally remembers her and what she is referring to. She slowly sheaths Needle into his neck, completing Lommy's death scene down to the gurgling of arterial blood from Polliver's mouth.
