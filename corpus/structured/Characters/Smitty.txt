 ​Season 4 

 During the Battle of Castle Black, Smitty takes part in defending the Wall against Mance Rayder's forces. As the wildlings approach the wall and start to climb, Smitty and another brother repel down with their bows. At Jon's signal, Smitty shoots his arrow and pierces a wildling in the shoulder, causing him to fall down to his death. As the members of the Night's Watch send oil barrels down on the wildlings at the gate, one barrel gets trapped on the ramp, as it explodes it sends flaming rubble across the Wall, and a piece impales the brother holding Smitty's repel rope in the chest. As the brother drops the rope, Smitty falls off the top of the wall to his death.\The Watchers on the Wall\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-135184222556cca72f06850 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances
