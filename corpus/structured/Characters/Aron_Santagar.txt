Ser Aron dies during the riots in King's Landing. Appearance 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Aron Santagar is the Master-at-Arms of the Red Keep. He's described by Ser Rodrik Cassel as a vain but honest man. In the first book, Ser Aron is secretly approached by Ser Rodrik to see if he might recognize the dagger used by the assassin sent to murder Bran Stark. He also participates in the Tourney of the Hand. 

Ser Aron perishes in the Riot of King's Landing. In the episode several courtiers are shown to be attacked by the rioting mob; it is unclear if any of these were meant to be Ser Aron. See also (major spoilers from the books) References
