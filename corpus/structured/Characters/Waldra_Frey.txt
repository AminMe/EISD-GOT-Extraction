 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, some of Lord Walder's descendants name their offspring Walder or Walda to incur Lord Walder's favor - a custom the Lord of the Crossing finds annoying. There's no mention of a daughter of Lord Walder named Waldra (apparently a variant of Walda), nor of any of his granddaughters or great-granddaughters having the name Waldra. References
