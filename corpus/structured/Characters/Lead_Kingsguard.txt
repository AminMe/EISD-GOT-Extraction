Biography
Season 5
He is one one of the five Kingsguard who guard King Tommen on his way to the High Sparrow. When the present members of the Faith Militant deny Tommen entrance to the Great Sept of Baelor because the High Sparrow is praying, the Lead Kingsguard asks for permission to kill the fanatics. However, Tommen is clearly hesitant about shedding blood on holy ground. Adding to this, some of the smallfolk gathered outside the Sept proceed to insult Tommen, calling him a bastard and an abomination. Seeing that they are hopelessly outnumbered, Tommen tactfully declines to give the order and says they will find another way to free his brother-in-law.Sons of the Harpy

&nbsp;In the books 
In the&nbsp;A Song of Ice and Fire&nbsp;novels, Tommen Baratheon never goes to meet with the High Sparrow. The name of this Kingsguard is not mentioned, but the candidates, by cross-referencing the events of the episode with the established background Kingsguard in the show, are: Preston Greenfield (who was established to be alive in Season 4 unlike his book counterpart), Boros Blount (even though in the Histories &amp; Lore he's referred to as the Fat and isn't young), Arys Oakheart, Balon Swann, and Osmund Kettleblack.
