 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, both Sansa and Tyrion are aware that all of Sansa's maids are spies of Cersei. Thus Sansa is careful not to reveal her true feelings to any of them, and Tyrion takes precautions when he meets Shae. 

When Tyrion hears servants joke about him that he still has not had sex with Sansa, he figures that Sansa's maids are the ones who spread the gossip. 

Tyrion complains to his father Why is it that all of Sansa's maids are women in Cersei's service? I am sick of being spied upon in my own chambers. Tywin answers nonchalantly that if Tyrion doesn't like his wife's servants, he can dismiss them and hire new ones. References
