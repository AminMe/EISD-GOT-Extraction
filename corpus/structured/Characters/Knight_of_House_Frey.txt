She turns to the knights from the Riverlands in the inn to help her to take Tyrion into custody, accusing him of attempting to murder her son Bran Stark. She asserts her origin as a daughter of House Tully and then tells the Knight of House Frey that she knows his sigil and asks after Lord Walder Frey.
