Lord Rickard attempts to justify his killing of Willem and Martyn Lannister as vengeance for the deaths of Harrion and Torrhen although Robb Stark does not accept his rational and executes him for murder.\Kissed by Fire\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-158069107256cca6b1afe9f classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

While being tortured by Ramsay Snow at the Dreadfort, Theon Greyjoy guesses Ramsay to be Harrion Karstark under the impression that Ramsay would leave him alone once he correctly guessed where he was and who his torturer was. Theon guesses this unaware of the fact that House Karstark had left the Starks after the execution of Rickard, and thus he is still under the impression that the Karstarks are Robb Stark's bannermen and they are torturing him because of his treachery. Ramsay says that it is the truth, and Theon lets out a sigh of relief, before Ramsay suddenly victoriously proclaims to be a liar before cutting off Theon's finger.The Climb\/ref data-rte-instance130814-158069107256cca6b1afe9f classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Quotes

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Harrion Karstark is the eldest son of Lord Rickard, and also joins his father and brothers in the War of the Five Kings. 

Harrion however, takes part in the Battle of the Green Fork and taken as a hostage, whileit is his brother Eddard who is killed by Jaime Lannister during the Battle of the Whispering Wood. Eddard serves alongside his brother Torrhen as part of Robb Stark's personal bodyguard. When Jaime realizes that his army is lost during the Battle of the Whispering Wood, he makes a final push to single-handedly carve his way through the Northern army in an attempt to kill Robb Stark in single combat. Jaime manages to reach Robb's personal bodyguard and kill several of them, including Eddard and Torrhen, beforebeing knocked unconscious. 

Harrion is kept hostage at Harrenhal until the northern prisoners are released by Arya Stark and Jaqen H'ghar and Brave Companions turn on Ser Amory Lorch and deliver the castle of Lord Roose Bolton. Later Roose sends him, Robett Glover and Helman Tallhart to take Duskendale. They are defeated by the Lannisters. Harrion is taken captive, and his current whereabouts are unknown. 

Following his father's execution by Robb Stark, Harrion becomes Lord of Karhold. It is unknown whether Harrion is aware of that, and if he is still alive. 

Harrion's great-uncle Arnolf, who secretly collaborates with the Boltons, tries to get him killed that he can take over Karhold: he announces in public that he supports Stannis (intending to stab him in the back while fighting the Boltons), hoping that the Lannisters will execute Harrion as a punishment, then his sister Alys will become the heiress of Karhold. Arnolf plans to force Alys to marry his son Cregan, and after she gives birth to his son - they will gain ownership legally of Karhold. Alys, however, finds out about Arnolf's twofold treachery, escapes to Castle Black and informs Jon what her great-uncle is up to. She has no idea what became of her brother as a result of Arnolf's fake announcement. 

Eddard Karstark was apparently switched with his brother Harrion Karstark (or at least, the names were switched) so TV viewers who haven't read the books would not be confused that more than one character named Eddard exists, even though George R.R. Martin made it a point in the books to re-use certain names for minor characters, i.e. to emphasize that Robert Baratheon isn't the only person named Robert in the entire continent of Westeros. 

Ramsay Snow briefly masquerades as Harrion during one of the mind games that he plays on Theon. This isn't mentioned in the books, as virtually all of Theon's torture takes place off-page, and is only alluded to. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) (spoilers from the books) References
