 Background 

Bowen became the squire of Norren, a respectable soldier in service of House Forrester and befriended Gared Tuttle who was the squire of Gregor Forrester. He was known to be a squire for longer than Gared was, he was also concerned that he would never achieve anything higher. Iron From Ice 

Bowen is among the forces of the Northern army camped outside The Twins for The Wedding of Edmure Tully. He and Gared are sent to fetch more wine during which Gared notices that the Frey soldiers are carrying weapons, Bowen notices that Gared is concerned but doesn't take it seriously and tells him to help carry the wine. When Gared realises what is about to happen he is faced with a choice: save the oblivious Bowen from the approaching soldier or race back to camp to try and warn Lord Forrester of the threat before it begins, if he chooses the latter then Bowen is killed as soon as Gared begins to leave. In this case, Norren will ask Gared if he left Bowen behind. 

If Gared chooses to save Bowen then the two run back towards their camp but get separated in the chaos, however both manage to find Lord Forrester and Norren.
