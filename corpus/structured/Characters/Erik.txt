Erik was caught stealing weapons by Ser Royland Degore and brought to Ethan to be judged, Ethan has three options: he can remove three fingers the same way his father punished thieves, sent to join the Night's Watch or he can be freed and given food. If it's the last choice Erik is grateful but Ethan's advisers worry that it will lead to more like him. If one of the former two is chosen Erik is horrified but Ethan's advisers are satisfied. The Lost Lords 

If Erik was sent to the Wall then Gared Tuttle can find and speak to him there where Erik is extremely bitter about his situation and very angry with the Forresters, he wishes he could have had his fingers removed instead as he would have at least been able to go home afterwards.
