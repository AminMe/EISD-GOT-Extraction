Karlon Stark is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is dead by the time in which the show takes place. He was a younger son of the King in the North who was awarded lands on the eastern region of the North after putting down a rebellion of House Bolton of the Dreadfort. 

Over time, Karlon's seat, known as Karl's Hold, became known as Karhold. Karlon's descendants, the Karl's Hold Starks became known as Karstarks.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season1\/#!\/locations\/karhold\/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Karhold entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-137892344156cca6cc59386 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/karhold\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Karhold entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-137892344156cca6cc59386 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / In the books
