 Background 

According to Jaime Lannister, this man is from Pentos. Season 5 

While sailing to Oldtown, the captain is bribed by Jaime Lannister to smuggle him and Bronn into Dorne and keep the secret. However, he tried to sell this information to Obara Sand in Planky Town, she was insulted that he did not offer up such a vital warning for free, so she instead tortured it out of him. The Sand Snakes end up burying him up to his neck in the sand, gagged, and covered by a bucket filled with scorpions. Later, Obara kills the captain by throwing her spear, impaling him through the head.\Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-183207791556cca765b579f classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there is no parallel character. Jaime and Bronn do not travel to Dorne at all. Instead, Cersei sends Ser Balon Swann, who goes to Dorne on an official mission to take Myrcella back, so he does not need to smuggle himself into the country. References
