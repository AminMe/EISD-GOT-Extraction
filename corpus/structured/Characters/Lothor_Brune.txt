 In the books 

In A Song of Ice and Fire, Lothor Brune is a relative of House Brune of Brownhollow. He is a quiet, loyal man of middle age described as having has a squashed nose, a square jaw and grey hair. He is stocky and strong, and while not a handsome man he is not ugly either. In the books he was also present at the Tourney of the Hand, defeating Jory Cassel on a judgment by the King, tied with Ser Aron Santagar and lost to Ser Robar Royce. He tips off Petyr Baelish about Sansa Stark's request to spare Ser Dontos at King Joffrey's 13th nameday. He also takes part in the Battle of the Blackwater and is awarded with a knighthood afterwards, earning the nickname Apple-Eater for capturing a knight of House Fossoway and killing two more on the battlefield. 

When Ser Dontos spirits Sansa out of King's Landing after the Purple Wedding, Lothor is present on Petyr's ship, and commanded the team of crossbowmen that killDontos Hollard at Baelish's order (coincidentally, the same man Lothor was supposed to face at Joffrey's tournament). Lothor throws a burning torch on the rowing boat after Dontos is murdered, ensuring that his body is never recovered. He accompanies Littlefinger to his keep at the Fingers and later to the Eyrie. 

In the books, Joffrey's nameday tournament in which Dontos and Lothor are set to fight is held between men fighting on horseback. Possibly due to budgetary and time constraints, in the TV series they are preparing to fight on foot. This makes it somewhat of a misnomer that Lothar is specifically introduced as a freerider but he isn't fighting on horse. See also References
