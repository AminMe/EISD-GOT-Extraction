</p>
<h2 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Personality</h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">Tywin is known for his stoic, extremely intelligent, and calculating demeanor, but also his cold, manipulative, and often unfettered attitude, even for his family. The only person he held any sentiment towards was his late wife Joanna (whom he loved dearly), having died giving birth to their son Tyrion. Since then he expressed disdain towards Tyrion for the death of his wife, as well as for shaming Tywin and their family by being born a misshapen dwarf.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin insists that all he does is for the sake of his family. Tywin's own father Tytos was a generous and caring man, whose bad investments and indecision made House Lannister a laughingstock. Tywin had to rebuild his family's fortunes almost singlehandedly, and sees outward signs of caring and emotion as the same kind of weakness that his own father showed. Ironically, however, Tywin's harsh actions and unwillingness to serve as a caring father figure have resulted in severe emotional problems in all three of his children, who are all terrified of him. Jaime and Cersei have been having an incestuous sexual relationship since they were very young, partially due to the lack of any loving parental relationship either of them had. Tywin actually spent most of their lives away in King's Landing serving as Hand of the King, and with their mother dead, his children were functionally raised by servants. Tywin only sporadically visited his home at Casterly Rock, and on the occasions when he did return he would deal out severe punishment for any transgressions his children committed while he was away.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">What little relationship Tywin may have had with Tyrion was destroyed when Tywin had his marriage to the commoner <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Tysha","link":"Tysha","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Tysha]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Tysha" title="Tysha">Tysha</a> annulled, then forced Tyrion to watch as he had his guards gang-rape the girl. Tywin wanted to force all of his children into marriage-alliances to benefit House Lannister (as Cersei was later married off to King Robert), and he was offended that Tyrion risked such a future marriage alliance for himself by marrying a commoner for love. The hypocrisy in this is that Tywin <i>himself</i> married for love when he married his own first cousin Joanna, instead of entering into a marriage-alliance with another more powerful noble family. Over the years, Tywin seemed to develop an outright joy in inflicting petty humiliations on Tyrion, such as "rewarding" him on his sixteenth <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"nameday","link":"nameday","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[nameday]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Nameday" title="Nameday">nameday</a> by putting him in charge of the privys and sewers at Casterly Rock. Yet despite all this, Tywin is fully aware that Tyrion is the most intelligent and politically cunning of all of his children. Though this has driven him to despise Tyrion more, given that Tyrion is his least favorite son as well as his most valuable, Tywin has occasionally recognized Tyrion's intelligence by naming him acting Hand of the King and later Master of Coin, and betrothing him to Sansa Stark, all for the benefit of the family. When Tyrion is accused of murdering Joffrey, Tywin's reaction appears to show that he is not entirely convinced of Tyrion's guilt, knowing that Tyrion is much too smart to commit regicide in such an obvious manner, but rather than attempt to prove his son's innocence, he uses the opportunity to rid himself of Tyrion once and for all, either by execution or sending him to the Night's Watch. Though he seems to prefer the latter so as to avoid being branded a kinslayer, it is later implied that this was also part of a plan to push Jaime into renouncing his Kingsguard vows and taking his place as Tywin's heir in return for Tyrion's life.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Meanwhile, Tywin possesses a very conservative, patrician set of social values, in which women are suited to securing marriage-alliances and little else, not wielding power on their own. Thus in contrast to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"House Tyrell","link":"House Tyrell","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[House Tyrell]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/House_Tyrell" title="House Tyrell">House Tyrell</a>, in which female members of the family are trained in ruling and court intrigue as much as the men are, Tywin never trained Cersei how to rule. Without instruction from her father, because Tywin always disregarded her as simply a means to an end, Cersei turned into a queen who actually isn't very skilled at the art of ruling but who based her reign on her personal vendettas with Tyrion and Margaery.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Of his three children Tywin has the least shame for Jaime, but not outright respect. Tywin feels disappointed that Jaime wants to continue to be a member of the Kingsguard, as while it is the highest honor a knight can aspire to, it means that Jaime had to swear away his rights to marriage or inheritance, which would leave Tywin's hated son Tyrion as his heir.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin does have a generally good relationship with his younger brother Kevan, whom he shaped his whole life to serve as his faithful lieutenant. On the whole, however, for a man who claims to value family above all else, Tywin has hypocritically destroyed his relationships with his own children.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin is also shown to have no regard for his grandson Joffrey, knowing fully well that he is incompetent at ruling the Realm. He was shown as having no qualms with putting Joffrey in his place when nescessary, normally being cold and blunt with the boy and exerting authority over him when need be. At Joffrey's funeral Tywin openly tells his grandson Tommen that Joffrey was not a good king much to the chargrin of Cersei.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin lacks, or at least overtly lacks, the sadistic and bloodthirsty nature of his grandson Joffrey. Tywin is intelligent enough to weigh political reality against a desire for personal, petty revenge. When Tywin arrived at Lannister-occupied <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Harrenhal","link":"Harrenhal","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Harrenhal]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Harrenhal" title="Harrenhal">Harrenhal</a>, he put a stop to the pointless torture of captured smallfolk, simply because it would be a more efficient use of resources to put them to work. In contrast, during the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Sack of King's Landing","link":"Sack of King's Landing","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Sack of King's Landing]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Sack_of_King's_Landing" title="Sack of King's Landing">Sack of King's Landing</a> he allowed his army to pillage and rape throughout the city, devastating its inhabitants. Underneath his calm exterior, Tywin can be seen to take personal satisfaction in crushing his enemies, and particularly in inflicting petty humiliations on his son Tyrion. Tywin treated his plans for the Red Wedding as a necessity of war, and he had the Stark family sword, <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Ice","link":"Ice","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Ice]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Ice" title="Ice">Ice</a>, melted down because it was made out of irreplaceable <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Valyrian steel","link":"Valyrian steel","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Valyrian steel]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Valyrian_steel" title="Valyrian steel">Valyrian steel</a> which could be used to make other weapons. Privately, however, he bore a look of satisfaction as he personally threw Ice's wolf-pelt scabbard into a fire, since Robb Stark's Northern rebellion against the Lannister family was now virtually at an end, and his family was essentially safe from further harm at the Starks' hands.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Despite his ruthless and calculating nature, Tywin is shown to have a good side if he is impressed with someone, demonstrated when he treats his young cupbearer (unaware that she is Arya Stark) with respect and kindness when she displays knowledge and the ability to read, speaks openly with her and even allows her to eat his dinner when he is not hungry and treat herself to whatever she likes in the kitchen. He also demonstrates this side with his grandson Tommen, whom he knows will become a much better and wiser king than Joffrey, and shares his knowledge and wisdom concerning the duties of a king.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin is also much more diplomatic than Cersei or Joffrey, as while he doesn't trust any of the Great Houses apart from his own, he recognizes it as necessary to make some concessions to House Tyrell and House Martell in order to keep their valuable support. Following Tywin's death, Cersei spurns the Martells and re-ignites her previous rivalry with Margaery Tyrell, severely damaging both alliances and undoing Tywin's careful work in securing House Lannister.

This action spawned the original friction between House Lannister and Ned Stark, who correctly observed that the Lannisters only intervened when it was convenient, and that they could not be trusted. Further, Ned was disgusted that the Lannister army had dishonorably sacked the city and even killed Rhaegar Targaryen's small children (as Aemon recounts to Jon in the TV series). The first book explains that <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Gregor Clegane","link":"Gregor Clegane","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Gregor Clegane]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Gregor_Clegane" title="Gregor Clegane">Gregor Clegane</a> led the Lannister forces that found and killed the children; Gregor personally killed Rhaegar's infant son by bashing his head in, then - while covered in the blood and brains of her baby - raped and killed Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell. Tywin's defense when confronted by Ned was that he never personally ordered Gregor to kill the royal children, but Tywin also did nothing to punish Gregor. It is Ned's disgust at Tywin's actions during the Sack of King's Landing that drive how he deals with Cersei's betrayal, because even if Cersei's children are bastards borne of incest, Ned knows that Robert would have all three killed if he told him, and Ned fears that this would make himself no better than Tywin.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin pledged fealty to Robert in the aftermath of the conflict, and Robert agreed to marry Tywin's daughter Cersei. Tywin is proud of his son Jaime, a great warrior, but loathes his youngest son Tyrion, blaming him for the death of Tywin's wife, Joanna, in childbirth. The books make it clear that Tywin is unaware of the incestuous relationship between Jaime and Cersei.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin's actual position on female members of his family taking part in political decisions is somewhat ambiguous in the books - particularly because Tywin's behavior is noted within the narrative for being hypocritical and at times contradictory. He does act like a very conservative and patrician male head of his household, but other characters remark that his love for his late wife Joanna was so great that she was actually his closest advisor. In her adult life, Tywin seems to have shunned Cersei from politics, but this was not always the case. The books state that Tywin actually doted on Cersei when she was a little girl, and even shared his plans with her in secret. All of this changed as Cersei grew older, however, when Tywin forced her into a loveless marriage to Robert Baratheon to secure a political alliance. Cersei felt betrayed that the father who once included her in his strategies now used her only as a tool, and increasingly blamed it on the secondary status of women in Westeros society. As in the TV series, however, it seems that as Cersei grew older Tywin correctly realized that she simply wasn't very intelligent or skilled at politics, so he eventually stopped wasting the time and effort of trying to train her at all.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">His appearance is slightly different in the books, where he is completely bald with long golden "side whiskers" and green eyes flecked with gold.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Tywin's death is also slightly different in the books. When Jaime releases Tyrion from the black cells, he confesses that Tyrion's first wife, Tysha, was not really a whore, and Jaime had not arranged their encounter on the road. Tywin forced Jaime to tell Tyrion that story to teach him a lesson. Ergo, she (presumably) had genuinely loved Tyrion. Enraged by this revelation, Tyrion vows to take revenge on his family. Ignoring <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Varys","link":"Varys","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Varys]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Varys" title="Varys">Varys</a>' protestations, he climbs a long ladder up to a secret passage in Tywin's chambers, where, as in the TV series, he finds <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Shae","link":"Shae","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Shae]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Shae" title="Shae">Shae</a> in his father's bed and strangles her. He then confronts his father in the privy. Tywin tries to assure Tyrion that he still intends to send him to <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"the Wall","link":"the Wall","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[the Wall]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/The_Wall" title="The Wall">the Wall</a>, and is only awaiting <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Mace Tyrell","link":"Mace Tyrell","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Mace Tyrell]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-206502271956cca5967e3e2" href="/wiki/Mace_Tyrell" title="Mace Tyrell">Mace Tyrell</a>'s approval. The conversation turns to Tysha. Tywin remains belligerent, continually referring to her as a whore. Tyrion warns him not to use the word whore again. When he inquires what became of Tysha, Tywin nonchalantly retorts that she went "wherever whores go". Remembering his father's own lesson that one should never make an empty threat, Tyrion fires the crossbow at him. At the moment of his death, Tywin's bowels loosen, and the stench causes Tyrion to reflect that Lord Tywin Lannister did not in the end "shit gold".

Cersei readily latches onto this explanation, but imagines Tyrion mocking the idea. All present are ordered not to mention that a whore had been found in his bed.
