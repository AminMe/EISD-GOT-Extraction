In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Humfrey Beesbury was a knight of House Beesbury during the reign of King Daeron II Targaryen. 

He challenged his brother-in-law Ser Humfrey Hardyng at the Ashford Tourney, breaking twelve lances in what was considered the best fought battle of the day, that the smallfolk soon began calling “the Battle of the Humfrey's.” However Ser Humfrey Hardyng won the struggle and remained a champion. Prince Aerion Brightflame Targaryen subsequently used dirty tactics in a tilt against Hardyng, however, deliberately impaling Hardyng's horse through the neck, and as it fell Hardyng's leg was crushed underneath. 

Ser Humfrey Hardyng was therefore eager to join the side of Ser Duncan the Tall in the Trial of Seven, to take revenge on Prince Aerion. Hardyng's leg had been crushed but he insisted that he could still fight well as long as he remained mounted. His brother-in-law Humfrey Beesbury was similarly eager to join Duncan's side, for payback against Aerion. 

Humfrey Beesbury was slain in the first pass of the trial by seven, by Ser Donnel of Duskendale. Beesbury was impaled in the groin by Ser Donnel's iron-tipped lance - the first several feet of the lance snapped off and remained protruding from his corpse as it lay in a pool of bloodstained mud. His brother-in-law Humfrey Hardyng was also mortally wounded in the trial and died of his injuries soon afterwards. The artwork in the Season 4 Histories &amp; Lore featurette in which Humfrey Beesbury appears inaccurately depicts him fighting on foot. See also References
