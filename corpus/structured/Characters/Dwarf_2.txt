 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there are only two dwarfs jousting. They ride live animals, a dog and a sow. The one meant as a mockery of Stannis bears a shield depicting the black stag on yellow of House Baratheon. Stannis is also vilified in a song by Galyeon of Cuy, which depicts Stannis as an envious and evil man, bordering on an stereotypical fantasy evil overlord, planning on usurping the Seven Kingdoms.
