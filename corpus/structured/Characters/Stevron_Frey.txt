He admonishes his father for forgetting his courtesies. Walder reminds Stevron that he is not yet Lord and then reluctantly offers his hand to Catelyn.

 Family tree 

 In the books 

In A Song of Ice and Fire, Ser Stevron resembles a weasel, like his father. He has grey eyes. A man in his sixties, Stevron's appearance shows his age. Walder has groomed him for lordship of the house, though Walder often jokes that Stevron has been waiting for him to die for forty years. Through his father, Stevron has learned to place great importance on the family. Stevron, unlike his father is amiable and reasonable. In the book Stevron rides out to parley with the Stark army on their arrival. 

Stevron participates the council of Robb and his bannermen at Riverrun. He suggests to sit on the fence and let the two kings fight each other, then bend their knees to the winner or oppose him, as they see fit. He also suggests to offer truce to Tywin Lannister, but is sharply silenced by other lords who wouldn't hear of making peace with the Lannisters. 

He is badly wounded at the Battle of Oxcross but no one thought his wounds were fatal; nonetheless he was found dead in his tent three days later, having succumbed to his injuries. When the news about his death reach Winterfell, Lord Walder's grandsons are not sad at all to hear their uncle is dead, they only argue who is the heir now. 

Following Stevron's death, due to the primogeniture laws of the Seven Kingdoms, his own son Ryman become next in line to succeed Lord Walder, ahead of Walder's numerous younger sons. See also (spoilers from the books) References
