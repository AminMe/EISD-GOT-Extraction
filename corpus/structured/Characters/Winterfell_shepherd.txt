 Background 

He and his family live in the lands of House Stark of Winterfell. His sons are fighting in the army of King Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. Season 2 

In the great hall of Winterfell, Prince Bran Stark holds court for his people. His brother Rickon Stark sits beside him, shelling nuts loudly with a rock. The shepherd reports being unable to tend to his flock with his three sons fighting in the south. He reassures Bran of the loyalty of his sons but says that there are growing numbers of wolves in the north and that he cannot protect his sheep from them alone. Bran offers to assign two orphans, Billy and Jack, from Winterfell's outlying Winterstown to aid him if he will give them room and board. The shepherd gratefully accepts, saying that his wife always wanted more children.\The Ghost of Harrenhal\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-38227848556cca7671ca27 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Winterfell is later seized by Theon Greyjoy. Bran and Rickon escape and pass close by to the shepherd's farm. Theon tracks them there and brutally questions the shepherd who denies having seen them. Dagmer finds nutshells and tells Theon to send Maester Luwin back to Winterfell. Theon later returns to Winterfell with the charred corpses of two boys, pretending that they are the Stark princes.\A Man Without Honor\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-38227848556cca7671ca27 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

Theon tries to give Dagmer a pouch of gold for the shepherd, to compensate him for his trouble, but Dagmer reveals to Theon that he killed the shepherd and his wife to prevent them from revealing that the two corpses were those of the orphans.\The Prince of Winterfell\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-38227848556cca7671ca27 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances 

 In the books 

In A Clash of Kings, in which most of Season 2 is based, there's no shepherd that adopts two orphans. Nevertheless, there's a miller and his wife from Winterstown whose two sons are killed to facilitate an identical ruse. References
