 Quotes 

 Behind the scenes 

During Season 1 it was believed that Fortune was playing Bowen Marsh, andDennis McKeever was playing Yarwyck, based on comments by Fortune and McKeever's character deliveringa line said by Yarwyck in the books. Neither of them were absolutely confirmed to be playing these characters, however, as their names were never stated in on-screen dialogue or in the credits. McKeever reappeared in Seasons 2 and 3 in a background role in the Great Ranging, in which Yarwyck didn't partake. In Season 4, Fortune's character was directly identified in on-screen dialogue as Yarwyck, and Michael Condron was subsequently cast as Marsh for Season 5. This establishes that Fortune's character should always be considered to have been Yarwyck, while McKeever was simply playing an unnamed Night's Watch officer. While this might technically be a retcon, Season 1 never absolutely confirmed which characters these actors were playing, so it introduced no internal continuity errors. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Othell Yarwyckis described as lantern-jawed. It is not explained how he, a highborn Westerman, ended up at the Wall. 

He is not present when Jon Snow is taken before Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt. Yarwyck, like Bowen Marsh, is initially helpful and supports Jon ever since he is elected to be the Lord Commander. To Jon's opinion, Marsh and Yarwyck are no lickspittles, and that was to the good, but they are seldom any help either. More and more, he finds he knows what they are going to say before he asks them. 

Jon sends Yarwyck with his Builders to restore the Nightfort. Later he returns to Castle Black. 

However, both of them gradually grow angry and disapproving of Jon's conduct, especially his decision to bring the Wildlings south of the Wall and to accept them to the Night's Watch. Yarwyck claims the Wildlings are more trouble than they’re worth, sloppy, careless and lazy, and while there are some good woodworkers among them, they won’t do as they are told. Marsh and Yarwyck also object to Jon's decision to man the abandoned forts with the Wildlings: Bowen Marsh states that We should be fitting them for nooses, not giving them our castles, and Yarwyck says My lord had as well present us with a pack of wolves and ask which we’d like to tear our throats out. 

When Jon consults with his subordinates what to do about the Wildlings in Hardhome, they all object, and Yarwyck claims it is a cursed place, even Benjen Stark used to say that. After receiving the distress message from Cotter Pyke, Yarwyck advises Jon to send Tormund there. 

Yarwyck is in league with Bowen Marsh and the other who oppose Jon in his alliance with the Free Folk. He is present when Jon announces that he intends to ride to Winterfell and kill Ramsay Bolton. Jon notices him and Marsh slipping out with all their men behind them, but unwisely disregards that. It is not mentioned whether Yarwyck is one of those who stab Jon, following Wick Whittlestick and Marsh. See also (spoilers from the books) References
