 Background 

Cersei's black-haired son is her first-born child, and the only of her children whose father is King Robert Baratheon. Very little is known about him: that he had black hair; resembled Robert a lot; and died as a result of a fever. His name, year of birth and age at the point of his demise are unknown. Season 1 

When Catelyn Stark watches over Bran, who has not woken up after having fell from the tower, Cersei comes to visit. She tells Catelyn that years ago she has lost her first boy, a little black-haired beauty. She and Robert were nearly driven mad by the child's death.\The Kingsroad\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-127894043256cca6027b640 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

Robert and Cersei talk about the imminent Dothraki's invasion and their unhappy marriage. Cersei says that she has felt something for Robert once, even after they lost their first boy, for quite a while.\The Wolf and the Lion\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-127894043256cca6027b640 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Family tree 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cersei never gave birth to any of Robert's children. When Eddard Stark confronts her about the identity of the father of her children, she admits that Jaime is their father, and that she loathes Robert since their first night, for coming to their bed drunk and calling her by Lyanna's name. She also reveals that Robert got her pregnant once, and her brother found a woman that could end the pregnancy. Robert was unaware of both the pregnancy and the abortion. References
