 Background 

She is a wilding who resides in Hardhome with her mother, Karsi, and sister, Johnna. Season 5 

Johnna and her sister are evacuated from Hardhome after Karsi agrees to Tormund and Jon Snow's plan to resettle the wildlings in The Gift, in exchange for military support when the White Walkers finally assail the Wall. As she loads them into a boat, Johnna and her sister ask Karsi if she'll go with them, to which their mother replies that she'll follow shortly. Karsi is killed shortly thereafter in the Massacre at Hardhome, but her daughters at that point have reached the safety of the Night's Watch ships. 

Johnna and her sister later arrive at Castle Black along with Tormund and the rest of the Wildling host.\The Dance of Dragons\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-102637584456cca740329f9 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances
