 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, no Dothraki Khal named Ahko has been mentioned in the storyline as of the fifth novel, A Dance with Dragons. However, the storyline in which Ahko is involved in the show will not appear in the books until the sixth book in the series, The Winds of Winter, which has not been released yet, so he could appear in that book.
