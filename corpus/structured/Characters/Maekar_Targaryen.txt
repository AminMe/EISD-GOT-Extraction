 Background 

Maekar was a King in the Targaryen dynasty. Unlike the majority of their forbears, Maekar and his siblings - Baelor, Aerys, Aelinor, and Rhaegel - were not born out of marriage between brother and sister. Instead, their father Daeron II and his sister Daenerys respectively wed Myriah and Maron Martell in order to unite Dorne with the Iron Throne.\House Martell (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-8871476556cca6518bd8e classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /\Robert's Rebellion (Histories &amp; Lore)\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-8871476556cca6518bd8e classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Since his only sister Aelinor married Aerys, Maekar wed another woman of Dornish nobility, Dyanna of House Dayne. He was the father of Aerion, who ultimately killed himself drinking wildfire; Aemon, who would become a Maester in Castle Black; and Aegon V Targaryen, who would succeed him to the Iron Throne.\Baelor\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-8871476556cca6518bd8e classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Although he was the fourth son, it eventually fell on Maekar to assume the throne and further the Targaryen dynasty after the subsequent deaths (one of which was actually caused by Maekar himself) of his three elder brothers. Maeker killed his oldest brother Baelor in the Trial by seven of Duncan the Tall, which was ironically provoked by his eldest son Aerion.\The Kingsguard (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-8871476556cca6518bd8e classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /\Justice of the Seven Kingdoms\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-8871476556cca6518bd8e classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Season 1
