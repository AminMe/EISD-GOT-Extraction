 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Donnel Waynwood is described as being a stocky man of twenty, with a wide nose and thick brown hair. Donnel is the second of Lady Anya's three sons: Morton, Donnel, and Wallace. Heserves at the Bloody Gate and leads the sortie that saves Catelyn Stark and her retinue from the Mountain clans at the Mountains of the Moon. After Ser Brynden Tully departs with his niece Catelyn, Donnel later replaces him as the new Knight of the Gate. 

Later at the Bloody Gate, Lady Anya introduces her grandson Ser Roland Waynwood, a muscular man about 25 years old, as well as her youngest son Wallace, who is identified as Roland's uncle. It isn't clear if Roland is Morton's son or Donnel's son. See also (spoilers from the books) References
