In the books

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Viserion is much the same. In contrast to his namesake, Viserion is noted as being the best behaved of Daenerys's three dragons, even compared to his brother Rhaegal. He is also the most friendly to other people besides Daenerys herself. His primary coloration is specifically cream, though he is often referred to as simply the white dragon.

Daenerys named Viserion after her brother Viserys. As she explained, Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened, yet he was my brother still. His dragon will do what he could not.

Viserion's name wasn't mentioned on-screen as of the end of Season 4, though it was stated in the Season 4 HBO Viewer's Guide, establishing that his name is the same in the TV continuity.http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-4/episode-10/houses/5/house-targaryen  His name was finally stated in on-screen dialogue in Season 5 episode 2, The House of Black and White.

Daenerys refers to her three dragons as brothers, but there is actually no specific reason to think that their eggs were all laid by the same dragon, or if the three eggs were even found in the same place or gathered individually. She may call them brothers more in the figurative sense that they were raised together.
