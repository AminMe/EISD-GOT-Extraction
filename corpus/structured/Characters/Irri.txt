Irri concurs with her fellow handmaiden. Doreah adds that Qarth is the richest city in Essos. Daenerys recalls her gift from Illyrio Mopatis, saying that the last time a rich man gave her a gown it was because he intended to sell her into marriage with Khal Drogo. Irri offers a Dothraki prayer for Drogo to ride forever in the night lands. Daenerys tells Doreah that they know nothing about their host and suggests that men often speak about other men when they are happy, suggesting that Doreah seduce some of Xaro’s fellow citizens to obtain more information. Doreah says that Daenerys would look like a real princess in Xaro’s dress and Irri objects to the title, correcting Doreah that Daenerys is a Khaleesi. Irri breaks the ensuing awkward silence by encouraging Daenerys to wear the dress as a guest’s courtesy to Xaro. Xaro throws a reception for Daenerys in his gardens. Irri and several of the khalasar are also present.

Behind the scenes
Acharia corrected speculation that Irri's death had occurred because she was unable to continue working in the United Kingdom due to work visa problems&nbsp;in a Reddit AMA, confirming that she could have continued on the show but the writers had decided to write out her character.http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uuiw2mrita_acharia_portrayed_irri_on_game_of/c4yprh0 Reddit

thumb|Deleted scene of Doreah killing Irri.
In a deleted scene, available on Season 2 Blu-ray, it was actually Doreah who strangled Irri to death, instead of just indirectly betraying her to her death. It must be remembered that this is from a deleted scene and thus it is not canonical and is not officially considered to have actually happened. Exactly why the scene was deleted, whether for plot reasons or simply for time constraints, has not been revealed.

Amrita Acharia gave another interview after her departure, noting that the death scene filmed for Irri actually gave her real bruises, “I think it’s hard to be strangled onscreen because obviously to an extent to make it look real, you really have to be a bit strangled. So I had massive bruises on my neck the next day. I was proud. Battle scars. Death scenes are fun.http://winteriscoming.net/2012/05/interview-with-amrita-acharia/ WinterIsComing.net interview with Amrita Acharia

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Irri is a Dothraki slave given to Daenerys by Khal Drogo to teach her how to ride. She is ethnically a Dothraki, but was enslaved when her own khalasar was defeated by another. She is the same age as Daenerys, and is fond of using the Dothraki saying, It is known.

Irri is usually seen paired with Daenerys' other handmaiden Jhiqui. In the TV series, however, Jhiqui only appeared briely in one scene during Season One, it seems that the TV series has functionally condensed both into one character.

In the books, Irri survives the journey through the Red Waste and Qarth, and is still alive when Daenerys leaves Qarth.
