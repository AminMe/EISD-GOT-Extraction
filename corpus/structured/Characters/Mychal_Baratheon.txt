 Background 

Mychal Baratheon is an early member of House Baratheon, the son of Orys Baratheon and Argalia Baratheon, and a distant ancestor of King Robert Baratheon and his brothers Stannis and Renly. Season 1 

He has an entry in The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, which notes the fact that he, along with all of his ancestors and descendents were born black of hair.\A Golden Crown\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-17429838656cca7c9baf57 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

Mychal Baratheon is mentioned only in the TV adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire and has no corresponding counterpart in the books. The page Ned Stark reads from The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms specifies that he was the son of Orys Baratheon, founder of House Baratheon. The full family tree of House Baratheon for all three centuries of its existence hasn't been revealed in the books yet, nor has specific mention been made of Orys' son, so it is possible that reference to Mychal Baratheon is based on notes from author George R.R. Martin. References
