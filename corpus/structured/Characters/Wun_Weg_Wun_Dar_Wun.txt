 Background 

Wun Wun is a Giant, and possibly the only non-human to reside in Hardhome. Season 5 

Wun Wun is present when Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane battle against the White Walkers. Wun Wun appears willing to support Tormund. Later, when the Night's Watch is gathering the dragonglass that Jon shared with the wildlings, as it can kill the White Walkers, Wun Wun is holding a dragonglass arrowhead, and Eddison Tollett approaches to tell the giant to give it up, though he is too afraid to do so because of his intimidating size. Wun Wun gets annoyed by his inaction and asks The fuck you looking at? in the giants' rudimentary form of the Old Tongue, so Edd goes away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead.\Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-97639461056cca5fd9e56f classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / When the Wights attack the village, Wun Wun single-handedly defeats about a dozen of them by ripping them apart, stomping on them, and defending himself with a large burning log. He then retreats into the sea with Jon and the remaining defenders. Being too large for the rowboats, he simply wades out into the bay for a long distance (not drowning due to his great height) to reach the larger ships waiting off shore. He is one of the few wildlings to escape the Massacre at Hardhome, and the fleet travels back to the Wall.} data-rte-instance130814-97639461056cca5fd9e56f classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

Alongside the other wildlings, he passes the Wall and leaves Castle Black to settle in the Gift. Many brothers of the Night's Watch are intimidated by him, having never seen a giant before.\The Dance of Dragons\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-97639461056cca5fd9e56f classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances

In the A Song of Ice and Fire\/i,link:A Song of Ice and Fire,wasblank:false,noforce:true,wikitext:A Song of Ice and Fire|A Song of Ice and Fire} data-rte-instance130814-97639461056cca5fd9e56f href/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire title=A Song of Ice and FireA Song of Ice and Fire novels, Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun is at least fourteen feet tall, even larger thanMag the Mighty, and possesses the strength of twelve men.Whilst typically passive and quiet, he will lash out if provoked.Unlike the savage giants in Old Nan's stories, he is vegetarian. He speaks theOld Tongue. 

Along with somewildlings, Wun Wun is discovered by Jon Snowwhen he leads new recruits to theweirwoodgrove in the Haunted Forest. With the help of some diplomacy by the new wildling recruitLeathers, they avoid a fight and manage to convince the wildlings and the giant to return with them toCastle Black. 

Wun Wun does not take part in the battle at Hardhome. It is unknown if he ever was there at all. 

Shortly after Jon announces he intends to travel south and fight Ramsay, he hears a commotion at Hardin’s Tower. He rushes there and sees Wun Wun smashing the head of a knight named Ser Patrek of King’s Mountain. Jon commands the gathering people to keep back and put away their weapons, and tries to calm the giant down. It is then Jon is attacked by his own men. 

Wun Wun's name is an in-joke by George R.R. Martin: an avid American Football fan, Martin named him after Phil Simms, quarterback for the New York Giants, whose jersey number was #11 - one one, or wun wun. See Also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
