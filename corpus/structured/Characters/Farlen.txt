 Quotes 

 In the books 

In A Song of Ice and Fire, Farlen is also the loyal kennelmaster of Winterfell. It was not him but Mikken the blacksmith who talked defiantly to Theon Greyjoy, and was killed for that. Farlen was falsely accused by Theon of killing three of the ironborn (who were actually killed by Ramsay Snow at Theon's command), and was beheaded by Theon. In the TV series, he was replaced by Ser Rodrik Cassel at the execution scene. See also References
