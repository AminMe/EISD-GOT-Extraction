She is the first character created specifically for the show. However, some fans have speculated that her role is based on the "red-headed whore" who appears very briefly in the first novel. This is strengthened by the fact that Bianco was originally announced as playing "Red-Headed Whore". She was originally only supposed to appear in the first episode at Winterfell when Tyrion visits the local brothel. According to the episode's Blu-ray commentary, the producers were impressed with Bianco's performance, particularly that even though the shooting location was freezing cold at the time of her nude scene, she acted through it and gave no hint of discomfort due to the temperature in her performance. Ros' role grew as Season 1 went through production, and as it became a recurring role, author <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"George R.R. Martin","link":"George R.R.

Sometimes they're conceived in the room, often they happen as we're writing individually, sometimes they're written as we're shooting when realize we need to service a character or a subplot… Ros sort of evolved as we went along — from day player to sort of exposition tool (a way of learning about Theon, Littlefinger, and Pycelle in Season 1) to, as you say, a kind of window into the world from the '<a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"smallfolk","link":"smallfolk","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[smallfolk]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-98418439156cca5ab657ac" href="/wiki/Smallfolk" title="Smallfolk">smallfolk</a>' POV in Season 2...and when certain scenes (the killing of the bastards, Cersei arresting the wrong whore) came up we decided to use Ros, since she was a character the audience was familiar with. It sort of became a "country girl moves to the city with big dreams" story that takes a lot of dark turns. And, as you saw at the end of last season, she plays a part in the Littlefinger vs. Varys subplot which was largely created for the show. And, it must be said, Esmé has turned in a very subtle and interesting performance through it all — if you track her from that first scene in 101 to the current season it’s a nice arc. But, yeah, I know some fans aren’t crazy about her.

<p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Loosely speaking, Ros does stand in for, or act as a condensation of, several different prostitute characters that existed in the books. For example, in the books Cersei does imprison a prostitute that she thinks is Tyrion's lover (although his actual lover is Shae), but it is a different character named Alayaya, the daughter of Chataya, the woman who owns the whorehouse. The entire subplot involving these prostitute characters was cut from the TV series, and Ros functionally assumes this role in the story. As Bryan Cogman himself noted:
</p>
<dl data-rte-empty-lines-before="1"><dd>"With Season 2, there’s a character in the book named Alyaya, who we didn't end up keeping. We knew that Ros would serve that function in the latter part of the season where Cersei thinks she’s caught Tyrion’s girlfriend but actually has caught Ros and doesn't know who she is. We had that in place...it's funny, it’s one of those things that kind of happened by accident. You’re finding different ways as you're plotting the season to examine different traits and characters.
</dd></dl>
<dl data-rte-empty-lines-before="1"><dd>There's a throwaway line in the second book where Tyrion says 'Oh, we should hire some whores for Joffrey, maybe that would let him calm down a bit.' And we thought, we have to see that scene. And what ended up emerging was that horrific, as horrific as anything in the show, scene where Ros and Daisy are made to abuse each other for Joffrey's sick jollies.
</dd></dl>
<dl data-rte-empty-lines-before="1"><dd>And then, the other thing that we sort of built into the show was the rivalry between Littlefinger and Varys...Ros seemed to be the perfect person for Varys to have an insider in Littlefinger's company…she came to Littlefinger's, trusted him, thought she had a rapport, and sort of had a rude awakening about who she is, and who she is in Littlefinger's eyes...."
</dd></dl>
<dl data-rte-empty-lines-before="1"><dd>"...There's a great divide in the fan community about Ros, which I think is pretty unfair to Esmé [Bianco] who's done an absolutely terrific job playing the part...In King’s Landing, for the most part, you're seeing things through the eyes of the nobles, and Ros gives you a window into the class of people they take for granted. It was fun this season to sort of explore those people on the margins. The other whore, Daisy, also did a fantastic job. In a weird way, it's a bizarro Sansa story. They both come to the capital with big dreams and an idea of what it's going to be like, a romantic vision. You see Daisy getting a little tour of the brothel and it's as if she's in Disneyland, she's wide-eyed, 'This is classy! This is a classy brothel, finally!' And what she doesn't realize is the classy brothel is probably the worst place to work. So that was kind of a sad little arc to play with."<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/thinkprogress.org\/alyssa\/2012\/06\/08\/496478\/game-of-thrones-story-editor-bryan-cogman-on-the-second-season-adapting-books-he-loves-and-the-shows-secret-main-character\/ Bryan Cogman ThinkProgress interview], June 8, 2012.<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-98418439156cca5ab657ac" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />

<p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Martin has stated that he intends to write the character into upcoming books, though in what capacity he has not specified. Ros' appearance in future books is now questionable following her death in Season 3.
