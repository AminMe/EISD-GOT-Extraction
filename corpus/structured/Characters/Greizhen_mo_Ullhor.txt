 Background 

Greizen mo Ullhor is of the Good Masters, the ruling elite of the city. He is an immensely wealthy slaver who has grown rich from the training and trading of the Unsullied warrior-eunuchs. Season 3 

Greizhen accompanies fellow Good Master Kraznys mo Nakloz and a third Good Master for negotiations with Daenerys Targaryen and is amused by Kraznys' comments about her. When Daenerys states that she wants to buy not just the fully-trained Unsullied but the slaves in training as well, Greizhen opposes, concerned that if these half-trained warriors fail on the battlefield it would shame Astapor.\Walk of Punishment\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-34347461156cca7041388b classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

 

Greizhen is present at one of Astapor's plazas for the conclusion of the transaction with Daenerys: the Unsullied and the half-trained boys in exchange for her dragon Drogon. He is killed when Daenerys orders to Unsullied to kill all the Good Masters, slave-drivers and soldiers in the city, sparing only the children, and liberate all the slaves.\And Now His Watch is Ended\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-34347461156cca7041388b classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, when Daenerys meets with the Good Masters, one of them, Grazdan mo Ullhor, is hesitant to sell the half-trained Unsullied because if defeated Astapor and the Good Masters would be shamed. The name seems to have been changed because Grazdan is a common name in Slaver's Bay. See also (spoilers from the books) References
