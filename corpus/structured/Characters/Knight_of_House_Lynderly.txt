 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, a member of House Lynderly of Snakewood is the first to offer himself as Lysa Tully's champion. Tyrion however doesn't recognize the Lynderly's identity. Later books identify two other members of House Lynderly: Lord Jon Lynderly and his son, Terrance, a young squire.
