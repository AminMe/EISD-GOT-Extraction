</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">His original name was actually "Dunk" - or rather, growing up as a street urchin in Flea Bottom with no knowledge of his parents or origins, that is the name he picked up as a small child and continued to use until Ser Arlan died (he doesn't remember how he got the name).  When he entered himself into the Tourney at Ashford as a knight, he was asked if "Dunk" was short for "Duncan", and he decided to say it was, because it was more formal and thus sounded like a better name for a knight (and for all he knew, maybe "Dunk" <i>was</i> short for "Duncan", given that he didn't know how he got his name).  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">It is strongly implied, but never outright stated, that Ser Arlan didn't actually knight Dunk before he died, but because the Tourney at Ashford was strictly only letting knights enter, Dunk decided to lie and say that Ser Arlan had knighted him before his death.  Any single knight can dub another man a knight, however, so for all anyone knew Ser Arlan actually did knight Dunk while they were alone on the road - squires are usually promised to eventually be knighted by the men they serve.  Dunk was Ser Arlan's squire for years, and earnestly wanted to be a chivalrous knight, and Ser Arlan may have even promised to knight him at some point in the future, but then he died very suddenly from a chill while on the road to Ashford, before he got the chance.  The matter is ultimately ambiguous.  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Somewhat like the later <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Sansa Stark","link":"Sansa Stark","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Sansa Stark]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-161466693056cca62f946e8" href="/wiki/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa Stark</a> or <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Brienne of Tarth","link":"Brienne of Tarth","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Brienne of Tarth]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-161466693056cca62f946e8" href="/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth" title="Brienne of Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</a>, Dunk became utterly enamored with Ser Arlan's teachings about the duty of a true knight to be chivalrous and defend the weak, and has a very idealized, almost <i>Don Quixote</i>-like belief in what knighthood is.  While this strikes many experienced knights as naive, many commoners he encounters - used to being abused by greedy and selfish knights - come to admire his simple but honest belief in the vows of a knight to always do what is right and defend the innocent.  During the Tourney at Ashford itself, Duncan became smitten with a beautiful and tall Dornish woman named Tanselle, but when she was assaulted by the sadistic Prince Aerion (for the flippant reason that she showed a dragon dying in her puppet show), Duncan walked up and defended her, punching Aerion so hard he knocked one of his teeth out.  Many cynically felt that striking a prince of the royal blood like this was suicidal and utterly naive - but others, including Aeron's own uncle Baelor, were moved by how Duncan lived up to a knight's vow to always defend women from attack, and how he shamed all of the other wealthier knights from major Houses who were ignoring Aerion's abuse.  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Initially, Dunk wasn't a very exceptional fighter when he came to the Tourney at Ashford.  Ser Arlan had grown quite old and as they were often scrambling from one place to the next looking for work, he was rarely able to spend time giving Dunk more than basic training in the art of swordsmanship.  Dunk had seen some combat with Ser Arlan, a campaign against a bandit lord in the Red Mountains.  More of Arlan's teaching was in his verbal instructions about what chivalry and knightly behavior are, which he could give as they traveled.  Dunk's one major advantage at the time was his great size and strength - but this was a poor match against a smaller but highly trained and skilled swordsman.  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The pair of "Dunk and Egg" had many famous adventures.
