Although he introduces himself courteously enough, he is clearly suspicious, having heard no news of Jaime's visit to Dorne; his suspicions are aroused further when he sees bloodstains on the stolen robes Jaime and Bronn are wearing. Although Bronn cautions him not to do something stupid, Trystane reaches for his sword, forcing Bronn to knock him out, to Myrcella's distress. Jaime then attempts to take Myrcella out of the palace, but he and Bronn are then attacked by Trystane's cousins, the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Sand Snakes","link":"Sand Snakes","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Sand Snakes]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-202307182056cca5db6c7b3" href="/wiki/Sand_Snakes" title="Sand Snakes">Sand Snakes</a>.

Doran defers to Trystane to decide, as he must learn how to punish lawbreakers if he must one day rule. Trystane agrees to let Bronn go on one condition: he will receive the same thing that he inflicted upon him. This meets with his father's approval and Bronn is brought before them and Areo elbows him hard across the face. Trystane later accompanies Jaime, Myrcella and Bronn to the harbor of Sunspear, where he remains silent, as the others say farewell to Prince Doran and Ellaria. However, Trystane's life is put in danger when Ellaria and the Sand Snakes secretly poison Myrcella. <img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[[The Dance of Dragons|''The Dance of Dragons'']]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-202307182056cca5db6c7b3" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />

<p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the <i><a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"A Song of Ice and Fire","link":"A Song of Ice and Fire","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-202307182056cca5db6c7b3" href="/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="A Song of Ice and Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></i> novels, Prince Trystane is the youngest son of Prince Doran Martell, the ruler of Dorne, and third in the Martell line of succession. He is the younger brother of Arianne and Quentyn Martell. He has olive skin and straight black hair. He is two years older than Myrcella Baratheon, making him about 12 years old when they are betrothed.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the novels, Trystane and Myrcella get along well, but never declare their love nor kiss.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">One of Cersei's ill-conceived schemes is to assassinate Trystane (it is not explained what she intends to gain by that). For that purpose, she sends Ser Balon Swann to Dorne, while the formal reason of his coming is to take Myrcella back and invite Doran and Trystane to King's Landing. The plan is as followed: on the way to King's Landing, somewhere in the kingswood, Ser Balon’s party will be attacked by outlaws, and Trystane will die. Prince Doran was asked to court only so that he may witness that attack with his own eyes, and thereby absolve Cersei of any blame. The outlaws will be shouting "Halfman, Halfman" as they attack. Ser Balon may even catch a quick glimpse of Tyrion, though no one else will. However, unbeknown to Cersei, the Martells have friends at court, and they forewarn Doran about the scheme.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">When Doran tells his daughter and the Sand Snakes about Cersei's scheme, they are shocked and can hardly believe - that Cersei seeks to murder Trystane, and that a Kingsguard knight is involved. Obara is furious, suggesting to kill Ser Balon and his party, and send their heads to Cersei. Doran rejects her offer, since Ser Balon <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"is their guest","link":"Guest right","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Guest right|is their guest]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-202307182056cca5db6c7b3" href="/wiki/Guest_right" title="Guest right">is their guest</a> and since the time is not yet come for Dorne to act openly against the Iron Throne. He explains in details how he intends to foil Cersei's plan without open defiance.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The casting announcement for Trystane in Season 5 describes him as the "heir to Dorne", even though in the books he has an older brother named Quentyn, and his father's eldest child and heir is actually his daughter Arianne. This may mean that Quentyn has been cut from the TV series.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">It still isn't clear if Arianne exists in the TV continuity or not. She is a major character and even a POV narrator in the books. On the other hand, in the books Arianne is furious that her father is treating his son Quentyn as his heir, despite the fact that under Dornish law she should inherit ahead of him. Later she discovers that this is because her father wanted to keep options for a vital marriage-alliance open, but he never thought of this as brushing Arianne aside. In any case, the supplemental bluray material has never stated that Dorne follows equal primogeniture, unlike the rest of the continent. In stray mentions throughout Season 4, when the TV series <i>could</i> have introduced that women have an equal chance of inheriting lordships in Dorne, they avoided it. A "<a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Lord Blackmont","link":"Blackmont (Lord)","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Blackmont (Lord)|Lord Blackmont]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-202307182056cca5db6c7b3" href="/wiki/Blackmont_(Lord)" title="Blackmont (Lord)">Lord Blackmont</a>" appeared in the Season 4 premiere, when in the books House Blackmont is ruled by a woman. When Oberyn recounts to Tyrion how he traveled to Casterly Rock when Tyrion was a baby, he says that his <i>father</i> took him on the trip - while in the books, it was his <i>mother</i>, the Ruling Princess of Dorne. Indeed, Dorne's equal primogeniture laws are one of its most prominent cultural features, setting it apart from the rest of the continent - as well as directly tying into <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Myrcella Baratheon","link":"Myrcella Baratheon","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Myrcella Baratheon]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-202307182056cca5db6c7b3" href="/wiki/Myrcella_Baratheon" title="Myrcella Baratheon">Myrcella Baratheon</a>'s major subplot in Dorne, as Arianne hopes to press the token excuse that under Dornish law, Myrcella would inherit the Iron Throne ahead of her brother Tommen.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">A major point standing against an omission of Arianne is that the only dialogue which previously mentioned Trystane (Season 2's "What is Dead May Never Die") described him as Doran's "youngest son" - indirectly establishing that TV-Trystane isn't an only child, and at the least, that Doran has another son who is older than him, so TV-Trystane <i>cannot</i> be the "heir to Dorne". So either the character description is misworded, or the TV series will have to establish an internal retcon with facts stated in Season 2.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Elio Garcia of Westeros.org suspects that the casting description of Trystane is simply mistaken, pointing out that he was earlier described as Doran's "youngest" son, and also that the casting description said that Tywin had arranged Trystane's betrothal to Myrcella, when it was actually Tyrion who arranged the betrothal (though Tywin subsequently supported Tyrion's action when he heard about it). Elio went so far as to reach out to his contacts at HBO to determine if this was simply a mistake by someone in the HBO PR department, and he did get a response, but it consisted entirely of a terse "no comment". Elio stated his belief that while he is somewhat nervous that there has been no mention of Arianne yet (or the Greyjoy uncles and other Northmen bannermen who appear at this point in the books), the SDCC casting announcement was in no way meant to be comprehensive, and as of yet he sees no specific reason to believe that Arianne has been outright omitted from the TV continuity.<img data-rte-meta="{"type":"ext","placeholder":1,"wikitext":"<ref>[http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Q69aQeKWLQ&list=TL5feCNxVwvySdbwuIZYe7SL0KQPguoTu6]<\/ref>"}" data-rte-instance="130814-202307182056cca5db6c7b3" class="placeholder placeholder-ext" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw==" type="ext" />
