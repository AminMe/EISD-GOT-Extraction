 Background 

Jafer Flowers is a ranger in the Night's Watch. His name, Flowers, suggests that he was a bastard from the Reach before joining the Watch. He and Othor accompanied Benjen Stark's ranging mission beyond the Wall. Both Jafer and Othor are killed while on this mission. Season 1

At night, the corpses rise as wights. While Othor attacks Lord Commander Mormont, Flowers causes trouble elsewhere before being put down and burned. Both bodies are re-burned the next day, to be sure. Samwell notes that according to a book he found in Aemon's library, the touch of the White Walkers can animate the dead.\The Pointy End\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-202977810156cca6a200081 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearance 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jafer Flowers' wight attacked the main castle garrison. The wight killed five men, among them Ser Jaremy Rykker, and continued to attack even after having its head cut off - it was only subdued after being chopped to pieces by a dozen swordsmen. 

His name indicates that he was originally born as a bastard in the Reach. 

Unlike in the series, when the bodies of Othor and Jafer were brought to Castle Black, both corpses had blue eyes - different from the eye color they had in their lives. 

Jafer's severed hand, which was torn by Ghost, continued to twitch and stir long after Jafer was destroyed. Alliser Thorne took it to King's Landing, but it had rotted away while he was waiting for an audience. See also References
