However, the Free Folk believe that Gendel survived the battle and, cutting his way through the ranks of the Night's Watch tried to return beyond the Wall through they same route the wildlings had come through. However, Gendel did not know the way as well as Gorne and he and his followers got lost trying to find their way out. The Free Folk believe that during the night the sobs of Gendel's children can still be heard and that those who venture into the caves and go too deep will be devoured by them.
