 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Adrack Humble is an ironborn raider and a member of House Humble, a lesser house descended from thralls and salt wives. He lost one of his arms in battle, but is still a fierce fighter. He has one rock wife and three salt wives, three of whom were pregnant when he left the Iron Islands. 

Adrack is among the ironborn that Victarion Greyjoy leaves to guard Moat Cailin under the command of Ralf Kenning. The garrison lives under constant attack from the crannogmen, who attack them with poisoned darts, resulting in the death of several men and the sickness of many others. 

Ramsay Bolton sends Theon Greyjoy to give peace terms to the Ironborn at Moat Cailin, promising them food and safe passage. The surviving ironborn are unsure whether to accept the terms or not. Dagon Codd firmly objects, reminding the others that Theon is the one called The Turncloak and they should not believe him. Then Adrack Humble kills Dagon by throwing an axe at his forehead. He tells the others threateningly that they must leave. The other ironborn comply. On the way to Ramsay's camp, Adrack tells Theon about his wives, promising that when he returns to the Iron Islands, he may name a son after Theon in grattitude. Theon is unimpressed, knowing what Ramsay plans for the ironborn. The next day, Theon notices that, among the sixty-three flayed bodies of the ironborn displayed on pikes along the moat, one of the bodies is one-armed.
