<h2 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Biography</h2>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">Sylvi is a wildling who grew up with her brother Cotter in a village near <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Hardhome","link":"Hardhome","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Hardhome]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-179983195956cca68704fe2" href="/wiki/Hardhome" title="Hardhome">Hardhome</a>. She was born with white hair, and was seen as a bad omen by the other villagers, who stayed away from her and had hoped that she would've died before her second name day. Because of her white hair, her mother gave her the nickname "Little Moon." After her second name day and Sylvi was given her name, the villagers threatened Sylvi's mother to leave the village. Instead, from what Cotter said in A Nest of Vipers, it is assumed that Sylvi's mother wrapped her in furs and left her in the forest to die. After Cotter had seen this, he went out and recovered Sylvi, and left the village and their mother.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">After a few years, Cotter was seperated from Sylvi, and was forced to join the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Night's Watch","link":"Night's Watch","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Night's Watch]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-179983195956cca68704fe2" href="/wiki/Night's_Watch" title="Night's Watch">Night's Watch</a>, leaving Sylvi to fend for herself in the wild for several months. Sylvi eventually settles in an abandoned hunting camp, where she keeps her possessions such as a talisman with a bear on it. It is assumed that the bear talisman was given to her by her mother, and she marks the trees with the symbol in hopes that Cotter will find her. At some point, she also came in contact with several female wildling hunters, who appear in Sons of Winter. Sylvi is proficient with a spear, knows how to hunt, and survive in the wild.

<p data-rte-fromparser="true">After seeing that Cotter has been treated for an injury or the actual injury on his arm, Sylvi begins questioning Gared on how Cotter got the injury. Regardless of what he says, Sylvi disapproves of Gared, saying that he didn't belong North of The Wall, and that she and her brother don't need to die for him trying to look for the North Grove. Sylvi adamantly decides that she and her brother are going to head South, to join <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Mance Rayder","link":"Mance Rayder","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Mance Rayder]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-179983195956cca68704fe2" href="/wiki/Mance_Rayder" title="Mance Rayder">Mance Rayder</a> and then goes off to hunt for food.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">After Gared leaves the camp, he interrupts Sylvi while she is hunting, accidentally scaring away a rabbit that she barely misses with her spear. After they talk a little bit, they continue hunting. After they've finished hunting, Sylvi asks Gared if he's ever lost somebody he's cared about, and tells him that she won't risk losing her brother again, not even for the North Grove. Gared is interested about what she has to say about the North Grove, and Sylvi tells him that a few years ago one of the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Ice-River Clans","link":"Ice-river clans","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Ice-river clans|Ice-River Clans]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-179983195956cca68704fe2" href="/wiki/Ice-river_clans" title="Ice-river clans">Ice-River Clans</a> set out to find it. She tells him that they had heard North Grove isn't touched by the cold, even during the Winter, and that the Ice-River Clan never returned.

Sylvi says that she knew them, then helps Gared and Cotter fight the Wights. During the fight, Sylvi tells Gared that fire is the only way to kill a Wight. After the fight, they see that more Wights are coming, and the trio flees North, hoping they can find refuge in the North Grove.
