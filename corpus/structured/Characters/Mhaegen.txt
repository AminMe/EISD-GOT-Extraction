In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Mhaegen appears but is not named. She has a a light red hair and freckles on her nose and bosom. Ned estimates she cannot be more than fifteen years old. 

She is killed by Allar Deem, a goldcloak sent by Lord Slynt, when she tries to protect her baby daughter. She was not explicitly shown to be killed by the goldcloaks in the TV series, thus her status in the TV continuity is uncertain. In the next episode, Ros mentiones to Littlefinger that Mhaegen works for him and that the Gold Cloaks killed her baby so she most likely survived the encounter.
