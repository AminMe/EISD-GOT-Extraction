Joss is a peasant from the Riverlands. Season 1 

He attends court in King's Landing escorted by some bannermen of House Tully to report a series of brutal raids being carried out by Gregor Clegane in the Riverlands.

 In the books 

In the Song of Ice and Fire novels, the handful of surviving smallfolk from the town of Sherrer are brought before the Iron Throne by a trio of knights from the Riverlands (Karyl Vance, Marq Piper, and Raymun Darry). The commoner who speaks directly to Ned Stark, and indicates that Gregor Clegane was responsible for the attack, is a brewer from Sherrer named Joss. The TV series credits only listed him as Riverlands refugee, but it is clear which book character he was portraying. See also References
