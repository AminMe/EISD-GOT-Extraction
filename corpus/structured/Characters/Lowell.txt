Biography 

 Season 4 

Lowell is at a tavern along with Polliver and several other Lannister soldiers, harrassing the Innkeeper and attempting to molest his daughter. Lowell is sitting down at a table, eating some chicken as Sandor The Hound Clegane and Arya Stark walk in. 

After Sandor argues with Polliver about giving him a free chicken, Polliver offers a trade - a chicken in return for letting the Lannister men take turns molesting Arya. He then gestures to Lowell, saying that he likes the girls he molests to be broken in beforehand. This ultimately leads to a brawl between Sandor and the soldiers. Lowell attempts to fight back, but is violently punched in the mouth by Sandor and he falls to the floor. After getting back up, Lowell again tries to swing at Sandor, but Sandor instead parries Lowell's sword into the crotch of another soldier. Lowell proceeds to tackle Sandor to the ground and holds a knife to his throat, but Sandor fights back and uses Lowell's own blade to stab him in the eyes multiple times, killing him.\Two Swords\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-190875931256cca727020c0 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearance 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there's no mention of one of the Mountain's Men being called Lowell. The people whom Arya and the Hound encounter and fight at the Inn at the Crossroads are Polliver, the Tickler and a squire of House Sarsfield. References
