 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dorna is the daughter of Ser Harys Swyft, the Knight of Cornfield and a loyal bannerman of House Lannister. Her father married her to Kevan Lannister and they have three sons: Lancel and the twins Martyn and Willem. They also have a daughter, Janei. Lancel is their eldest child and Janei the youngest. 

According to Kevan, Dorna is a gentle soul, never comfortable except at home with friends and kin around her. She prays seven times a day and loves needlework and flowers. 

Dorna is described chinless lady, flat-chested and chicken-legged with her lack of chin shared by her father, yet she is still very loved by her husband. 

It is unclear from Robert's comment about Dorna being a dumb whore with a fat arse whether her physical description was changed in the series (as done with many characters) or he called her that way just to insult Lancel. See also (major spoilers from the books) References
