 A tortured slave is a minor character in the third season played by guest star Mark Drake who debuts in Walk of Punishment. Biography 

 Season 3 

He is a slave who presumably showed insubordination of some kind to his masters, and after being viciously whipped is strapped to a cross and left to die out in public on the Walk of Punishment, as a warning to all other slaves. Daenerys Targaryen offers the man water, and he refuses to drink, saying that he just wanted to die quickly as drinking the water would only prolong his suffering.\Walk of Punishment\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-32798896156cca7779cba3 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances
