 Background

He's taken to the catacombs beneath the Great Pyramid where Rhaegal and Viserion are kept chained and watches in horror as the two dragons burn and devour another Great Master.\Kill the Boy\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-149609641456cca7b6ac3ac classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Appearances 

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there is no mention of a character named Elboneno. The name is one noble spelled backwards. The name doesn't fit the established naming conventions of the Ghiscari inhabitants of Slaver's Bay. 

In the books Daenerys never has the heads of the ancient slaving families arrested after the attacks of the Sons of the Harpy. Instead she has these families deliver a child as hostage. References
