 Biography 

 Background 

According to legend, Elenei was daughter of the sea god and the wind goddess. She fell in love with a mortal man named Durran, who took her as his wife. By giving up her maidenhead to him, Elenei became mortal, while Durran earned the hatred of Elenei's parents. 

 

In rage, the gods sent a storm to destroy Durran's keep over Shipbreaker Bay. Declaring war against them, Durran built a new castle, larger and more formidable than the previous one, though this one too was destroyed by the divine storms. 

Four more keeps Durran built and lost to the fury of the gods. Finally, the seventh castle, which Durran built with the aid of Bran the Builder, withstood the rage of the Elenei's parents and became known as Storm's End, while Durran earned the nickname of Durran's Godsgrief.\The Age of Heroes (Complete Guide to Westeros)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-145146974856cca731cf6ad classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /\The Stormlands (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-145146974856cca731cf6ad classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / See also References
