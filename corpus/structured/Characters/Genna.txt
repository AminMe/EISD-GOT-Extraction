 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no prostitutenamed Genna. The only character by thatname is Tywin Lannister's sister. This would seem to continue the TV producers' general practice that when they invent new characters for the TV series, they still try to use names from the books which are established to exist in Westeros (instead of making up entirely new ones, which might not sound like they fit). 

In the TV series, Tyrion pronounced Genna with a soft G, as opposed to a hard G. References
