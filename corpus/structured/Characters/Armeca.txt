==Biography==
===Background===
Armeca is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] working in a brothel in [[King's Landing]] owned by [[Petyr Baelish|Lord Petyr Baelish]].

===[[Season 1]]===
She is "tutored" by the newly-arrived [[Ros]], while Petyr lectures them on the art of seduction.<ref>"[[You Win or You Die]]"</ref>

===[[Season 2]]===
She continues to work for Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] and feigns that she cannot speak the [[Common Tongue]] to appear exotic to her customers despite being from [[Flea Bottom]] in [[King's Landing]] itself. [[Ros]] is aware of her using this ploy. She is present at Lord Baelish's brothel when the [[City Watch|gold cloaks]], led by Lord [[Janos Slynt]], appear to find [[Mhaegen]] and kill her daughter [[Barra]], one of the late King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]'s bastard children.<ref>"[[The North Remembers]]"</ref> When Ros is too upset to work because of this incident Lord Petyr assigns her customer to Armeca, who has only just finished with one of her own. Petyr mistakenly calls her "Aremca".<ref>"[[The Night Lands]]"</ref>

Armeca is in the [[Red Keep]] entertaining [[Bronn]] immediately before the [[Battle  of the Blackwater|Battle of the Blackwater]]. She admires his broken nose and asks how many times he has injured it. He tells her as he publicly undresses her. Their time is cut short by the arrival of [[Sandor Clegane]], who antagonizes Bronn. They face off against one another but are interrupted when the bells sound a call to arms.<ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>
