Along with a group of other dwarfs, he takes part in a mock reenactment of the War of the Five Kings at King Joffrey's wedding. He dresses as Renly Baratheon and rides a mount resembling Loras Tyrell. His naked rear end is exposed, a crude reference toRenly's homosexuality.

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there are only two dwarfs jousting. They ride live animals, a dog and a sow. Neither Renly nor the any member of House Tyrell is the subject of mockery in the wedding feast. 

On the contrary, the song Lord Renly's Ride, by Hamish the Harper, depicts Renly as repenting from attempting to usurp Joffrey and defying the Lord of Death to return to the world of the living to fight for him on the Battle of the Blackwater, and then returning to Highgarden to look once more at his beloved Margaery Tyrell. The song was inspired by the account of Renly's ghost fighting along the forces of House Tyrell and House Lannister - it was actually Garlan Tyrell wearing Renly's armor; in the show it was Loras himself. 

Hamish the Harper also sings A Rose of Gold in honor of House Tyrell. References
