 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tobho Mott is a native of the Free City of Qohor who learned to smith there, including the working of the fabled Valyrian steel. He moved to Westeros when younger and has successfully built up his own business thanks to his formidable skills. His armory is a large building at the top of the Street of Steel, impressive in size and outfittings. 

When Eddard Stark asked Mott who paid him Gendry's apprentice fee, Mott answered evasively, but eventually admitted it was a mysterious lord who did not identify himself that paid him both the apprentice fee and to keep his mouth shut about the youth. 

In the books, Mott is not interrogated about Gendry's whereabouts. It is not explained how the Gold Cloaks knew that Gendry was with Yoren's caravan. 

Mott, not a smith from Volantis, is the one who melts Ice to forge two new swords at Tywin Lannister's order. See also (spoilers from the books) References
