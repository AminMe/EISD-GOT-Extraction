 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Rylene Florent is not Shireen Baratheon's cousin, but Shireen's mother Selyse Baratheon's paternal aunt, which makes her Shireen's great aunt, as well as the aunt of Imry Florent and Melessa Tarly. Davos describes her as Shireen's cousin in the Season 3 finale, but he may have just been speaking loosely. Rylene Florent is married to Ser Rycherd Crane.
