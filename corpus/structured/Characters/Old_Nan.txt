Biography 

 Background 

Old Nan is an elderly woman living in Winterfell. She is a retired servant of House Stark known for her tale-telling abilities. She has entertained the children of Eddard and Catelyn with stories throughout their childhoods. Her great grandson Hodor is a stable hand at the castle. Season 1 

After Catelyn Stark leaves for King's Landing, Old Nan sits by Bran Stark’s bedside to watch him. She suggests the story of Duncan the Tall and Bran replies that he hates her stories —he prefers the scary ones. She retorts that he is a sweet summer child who knows nothing about fear, and tells him that fear is for the winter and for the Long Night, a winter season thousand of years ago that lasted a generation, in which those who didn't freeze to death had to face the White Walkers, who ventured south for the first time and swept through Westeros.\Lord Snow\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-108284612556cca626ae27a classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Theon Greyjoy interrupts another story and says that he would go mad if he was left alone with Old Nan.\Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-108284612556cca626ae27a classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Appearances 

 Behind the scenes 

Actress Margaret John, who played Old Nan, passed away only two months before Season 1 began to air, though all of her scenes had already been completed. The character does appear during the second book, however, in the TV series canon the showrunners decided to retire the character out of respect, so Old Nan is assumed to have quietly passed away between Season 1 and Season 2.

In A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Old Nan is the oldest person living at Winterfell. She came to Winterfell to act as wetnurse for a Brandon Stark, which one is unsure, only that his mother had died birthing him. This Brandon Stark is believed to be either the brother of Lord Rickard Stark or a brother of his father. She's retired but tells stories and legends to the Stark children. She lost two sons in Robert's Rebellion and her grandson during the Greyjoy Rebellion, while her daughters moved away and died. Her only surviving family is her great-grandson, the gentle, slow-witted Hodor. 

In the books, it is Old Nan and not Osha who interprets the arrival of the Red Comet to mean the return of dragons. 

Nan might be short for Nymeria. When Arya Stark is on the run after escaping from King's Landing, one of the aliases she uses is Nymeria, but she says to call her Nan for short. 

Among the stories she used to tell the Stark boys are: The last hero - who fought the White Walkers in the Long Night The ice dragon Harrenhal and Harren the Black The Night's King Symeon Star-Eyes How the Children of the Forest taught the First Men to send messages by raven The Rat Cook The Mad Axe The Thing That Came In The Night 

Following the Sack of Winterfell, Old Nan is brought to the Dreadfort. Her fate is unknown. See also References
