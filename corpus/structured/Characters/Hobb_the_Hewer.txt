In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Hobb the Hewer was a woodsman who gained fame during the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. 

During the Storming of the Dragonpit, Hobb managed to slay the dragon Shrykos when he managed to leap on the dragons neck, driving his axe into the beasts skull as Shrykos tried to shake him off. Hobb locked his legs around the beasts neck and continued to rain blows on the dragons skull. The seventh blow (known as the Stranger's blow) ended Shrykos' life. 

Some tales also claim Hobb slew the dragon Syrax, however most historians concur this is highly unlikely. It is unknown if Hobb survived or not, he most likely was slain when the Dragonpit collapsed. See also References
