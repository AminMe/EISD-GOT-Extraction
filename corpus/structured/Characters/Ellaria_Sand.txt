'''Ellaria Sand''' is a major character in the [[Season 5|fifth]] and [[Season 6|sixth]] seasons. She initially appeared as a recurring character in the [[Season 4|fourth]] season, debuting in "[[Two Swords]]". She is portrayed by starring cast member [[Indira Varma]]. Ellaria is the [[Paramour|paramour]] of Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] of [[Dorne]] and a [[bastard]] of [[House Uller]]. "Sand" is the surname used for noble-born bastards in Dorne, like "Snow" in [[the North]].

After Oberyn is killed while championing [[Tyrion Lannister]] in a trial by combat against [[Gregor Clegane]], Ellaria pressures Oberyn's brother, [[Doran Martell]], to go to war against the Lannisters, and hatches a scheme with three of [[Sand Snakes|Oberyn's bastard daughters]] to kill [[Myrcella Baratheon]], the daughter of [[Cersei Lannister]], as revenge for Cersei unjustly accusing Tyrion, since it led to Oberyn's death. Though she is temporarily stopped and threatened with execution by Doran, Ellaria secretly poisons Myrcella.

==Biography==
===Background===
Ellaria is the mother of four of Prince [[Oberyn Martell]]'s eight bastard [[Sand Snakes|daughters]]. Her eldest daughter is [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]]. Like Oberyn, Ellaria is attracted to both men and women.<ref>"[[The Dance of Dragons]]"</ref>

===[[Season 4]]===
[[File:EllariaBastardsVid.jpg|thumb|right|Ellaria partakes of King's Landing's entertainment.]]
After their arrival in [[King's Landing]], Ellaria and her lover, Prince [[Oberyn Martell]], head to one of [[Littlefinger]]'s brothels. Oberyn examines three whores while Ellaria lies on the bed, asking her which one she would like. She says that she doesn't want a timid one and he eventually finds one to her liking. When [[Olyvar]] calls Ellaria "my lady", she calls him out for using a lie to address her and tells him to call her what she is: a [[bastard]]. When Oberyn hears men singing the [[Rains of Castamere]] in the next room, Ellaria tries to stop him but can only watch as Oberyn takes out his rage on the Lannister men-at-arms. She proceeds to passionately kiss him as [[Tyrion Lannister]] and Bronn enter the room seeking Oberyn.<ref>"[[Two Swords]]"</ref>
[[File:OberynEllariaPW.jpg|thumb|left|Ellaria Sand and Oberyn Martell are greeted by Tywin and Cersei at Joffrey's wedding.]]

Ellaria and Oberyn attend [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey's]] [[Purple Wedding|wedding]], where she is introduced to [[Tywin Lannister]] and [[Cersei Lannister]]. Cersei subtly (and hypocritically) mocks her bastard status, instigating a debate over the cultural differences between the Dornish and the rest of Westeros. She later witnesses the poisoning of King Joffrey.<ref>"[[The Lion and the Rose]]"</ref>

[[File:Oberyn_and_Ellaria_-_Breaker_of_Chains.jpg|thumb|Ellaria and Oberyn are interrupted.]]
In the days following Joffrey's death, Ellaria and Oberyn again visit the brothel. On this occasion, Ellaria is serviced by [[Marei]] and [[Whore (The Warrior)|another woman]]; Ellaria steals a kiss from Olyvar, who apologizes and says he simply hasn't developed the taste for women. Ellaria soothes Oberyn's anger at the suggestion that she is an "acquired taste", by reminding him that this means he has Olyvar to himself. Ellaria leaves when Lord Tywin unexpectedly shows up and asks to meet privately with Oberyn, but says that Oberyn need only call if he needs her.<ref>"[[Breaker of Chains]]"</ref>

[[File:Ellaria_terrified_-_The_Mountain_and_the_Viper.png|thumb|left|Ellaria screams in horror as she watches the brutal death of Oberyn.]]
During Tyrion's trial by combat, Ellaria, in spite of having heard tales of [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] for years, is somewhat disturbed to see exactly how large he really is, expressing with disbelief, "you're going to fight ''that''?!". Ellaria watches with Tyrion from the sidelines and is delighted when it looks like Oberyn has won. When Oberyn demands that Gregor confess his crimes before he dies, he meets Ellaria's eyes and she nods approvingly. Her delight turns to shock and horror when the Mountain gains the upper hand on Oberyn and crushes his skull, at which she can do nothing but scream.<ref>"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]"</ref>

===[[Season 5]]===
[[File:5x02-03.jpg|thumb|left|Ellaria confronts Prince Doran.]]
At the [[Water Gardens]], Ellaria, still in mourning clothes, observes [[Trystane Martell]] and [[Myrcella Baratheon]] from a distance. She approaches Prince [[Doran Martell]], but her path is initially blocked by Captain [[Areo Hotah]]. Ellaria threatens Areo before the captain is ordered by Doran to stand down. Angrily, Ellaria scolds Doran for his apparent inaction at the news of Oberyn's death. Doran plans to bury and mourn his beloved brother, but Ellaria and Oberyn's [[Sand Snakes|daughters]] want the Dornish people to take up arms and avenge their fallen prince. She also voices her contempt for Myrcella and wants to harm her in order to take revenge on Cersei for falsely putting Tyrion on the show trial that led to Oberyn's death. Doran strictly forbids this, stating that under his rule, they will not mutilate little girls for revenge. Ellaria voices doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing and leaves.<ref>"[[The House of Black and White]]"</ref>

[[File:Sand Snakes torture with scorpions.png|thumb|Ellaria plots with the Sand Snakes.]]
She later meets with [[Obara Sand|Obara]], [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]] and her daughter [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]], telling them that Doran will mourn for Oberyn but won't do anything. As Obara points out that they have no army without the support of the Prince to challenge the Lannisters Ellaria says that they won't need an army because they have Myrcella. Nymeria informs her that there's perhaps a problem, presenting her the [[merchant captain]] who smuggled Jaime Lannister to Dorne and tried to sell this information to Obara, just to end buried in the sand. Ellaria realises that Jamie has come for Myrcella and asks the three which way they choose, Doran's or hers. Tyene is the first one declaring for her, followed by Nymeria and then Obara, who makes her point by telling how she first met Oberyn, when she made her choice, and then she uses her spear to kill the captain.<ref>"[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)]]"</ref>

Ellaria and the Sand Snakes return to the Water Gardens to kidnap Myrcella and use her for their revenge against the Lannisters. They swear, by the words of [[House Martell]], to do what is needed to avenge Oberyn. However, Prince Doran had forseen their attempt to take Myrcella and his guard, led by Aero Hotah, arrests the Sand Snakes and Ellaria for their treachery.<ref>''[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]''</ref>

[[File:Meeting in dorn jaime myrcella.jpg|thumb|left|Ellaria is present when Jaime Lannister is brought before Prince Doran.]]
Ellaria is later brought before Doran to receive Jaime, though she is openly hostile towards him, calling him Kingslayer and refusing to drink a toast to Tommen as the new King. On her way out, she insults Doran, who in turn threatens to kill her if she speaks to him like that again. Later, Doran issues Ellaria an ultimatum: pledge allegiance to him, or die. She tearfully complies. She later visits Jaime in his quarters and makes amends with him, knowing that neither he nor Myrcella played any part in Oberyn's death, but expresses her knowledge that Myrcella is not Jaime's niece, but his daughter. Before leaving, she mocks him for not being born centuries ago into the Targaryen family, in which position his incest would have been accepted.<ref>"[[The Dance of Dragons]]"</ref>

[[File:Myrcella-ellaria-kiss.png|thumb|Ellaria poisons Myrcella.]]
As the Sand Snakes say goodbye to the expedition back to King's Landing, Ellaria kisses Myrcella on the lips. As the ship is away in the horizon, Ellaria wipes blood from her nose and takes an antidote for the poison coated on her lips, which has just taken Myrcella's life on the boat, and walks away silently, contemplating what will follow when Doran finds out that she has betrayed him ''and'' put his son's life in danger.<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*On the [[Season 4]] Blu-ray, Ellaria narrates the [[Histories & Lore]] videos on '''"[[The Bastards of Westeros (Histories & Lore)|The Bastards of Westeros]]"'''.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ellaria Sand is the paramour of Prince Oberyn Martell. She is the [[bastard]] daughter of Lord Harmen Uller, the Lord of [[Hellholt]] - thus she is one of the "Sandy [[Dornishmen]]" of the central desert of [[Dorne]], who possess particularly dark skin, burned brown by the hot desert sun. Her hair and eyes are also black. She is described as not explicitly beautiful, as she is no longer a young woman and has borne four children, though still attractive and eye-catching, with an exotic, sensuous flair. Like her partner Oberyn, she expresses sexual interest in both women and men. It is not unusual for lords and ladies in Dorne to be openly bisexual, due to the relaxed attitude towards sexuality among the Dornish. She's rumored to worship a [[Lys]]ene love godess and is dubbed "The Serpent's whore" - the serpent in question being Oberyn Martell - by [[Olenna Redwyne]].

Ellaria is the mother of the four youngest of Oberyn's eight bastard daughters, who are all collectively known as the "Sand Snakes". Ellaria's four daughters with Oberyn are Elia, Obella, Dorea, and Loreza Sand.

In the books, Ellaria doesn't advocate war against the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], much less exacting revenge by harming Myrcella. In fact, she urges against war, because she is worried the cycle of revenge will continue until even her youngest daughters are eventually consumed by it. The role of going against Doran's orders by trying to spark a war is at first taken up by the three eldest Sand Snakes: Obara, Nymeria and Tyene. In fact, Obara is the one who approaches Doran in the Water Gardens and accuses him of inaction. However, the Sand Snakes act independently instead of under Ellaria's directive, and are soon reined in by Doran anyway. Later, it is Arianne, Doran's daughter and heir, who urges for war and actually puts a plan in motion using Myrcella, though it doesn't involve harming her either.

During Arianne's failed plot, Myrcella is the target of an assassination attempt by one of Arianne's own supporters: Ser Gerold Dayne, the Knight of High Hermitage, head of a lesser branch of [[House Dayne]], though Arianne was unaware of Dayne's motives. Unlike in the show, Myrcella survives the injury but is left disfigured, and Doran orders a manhunt for Dayne.
