 In the books 
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Prince That Was Promised is implied to be the reincarnation of a hero known asAzor Ahai. He was a legendary warrior who rose up and defeated the Others - the books' name for the White Walkers - during the Long Night. He wielded a sword of fire, called Lightbringer. There is some debate amongst fans as to the interchangeability of Azor Ahai and The Prince That Was Promised. It seems that Azor Ahai is the name given to the legendary figure, while the Prince That Was Promised is more properly his reincarnation. However, the books do not in fact make explicit the connection between the stories of Azor Ahai and the prophecies of the Prince That Was Promised.
The prophecy about the Prince That Was Promised said he would be born from the line of House Targaryen - Stannis Baratheon does match this description because his grandmother was a Targaryen.
