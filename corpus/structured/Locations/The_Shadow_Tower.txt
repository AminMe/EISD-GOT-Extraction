In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Shadow Tower is under the command of Ser Denys Mallister, an experienced and conservative commander, and uncle to Lord Jason Mallister of Seagard. It is not the western-most castle on the Wall, which used to be Westwatch-by-the-Bridge. However, Westwatch has fallen into ruin and is no longer garrisoned. Qhorin Halfhand was usually based at the Shadow Tower. 

According to Jeor Mormont, at the start of the books there are about 200 soldiers in the Shadow Tower. Qhorin led 100 of them to the Great Ranging. 

Patrols and scouts from the Shadow Tower have to keep a close eye on the surrounding terrain. Though extremely difficult, it is possible to by-pass the Wall by descending through the Gorge and crossing the Bridge of Skulls, or by tracing a dangerous route through the Frostfangs to the west. The Night's Watch has to keep an eye on these routes for signs of wildling activity. See also References
