In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Starfall is the seat of House Dayne. It is located at the mouth of the River Torentine, downriver from Blackmont and the High Hermitage, which is held by a lesser branch of the Daynes. 

Starfall is so-called because of a meteor, referred to as a fallen star, which fell out of the sky nearby, almost two thousand years ago. The Daynes forged a sword out of the meteorite ore, called Dawn, which is as resilient and formidable as a Valyrian steel weapon in combat. See also (spoilers from the books) References
