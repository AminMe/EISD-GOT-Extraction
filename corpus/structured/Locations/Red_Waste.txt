 The Red Waste is a desert region on the continent of Essos, located thousands of miles to the east of Westeros. It is located south of the Dothraki Sea and Lhazar, northwest of Qarth, and east of Slaver's Bay. It is a harsh sandy wilderness that even the Dothraki fear to cross.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/red-waste\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Red Waste entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-63887067456cca8817ebde classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / History

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Red Waste is extremely large, taking weeks to cross, and is unrelentingly hostile. Water is scarce and food sources almost non-existent. The wasteland is located east of Slaver's Bay and west of the Jade Sea. The city of Qarth lies southeast of the waste. Its southern edge runs along the Summer Sea. 

There are ruins in the waste, suggesting that at one time it was much more pleasant and habitable than now. One such ruined city is called Vaes Tolorro, the City of Bones. Several of the ruined cities were actually colonies of Qarth which were destroyed by the Dothraki when they swept across Essos after the Doom of Valyria, during the Century of Blood. The Dothraki never reached as far as Qarth itself, however, because of the vast distance across the Red Waste. These oasis-colonies were once suitable for habitation due to large irrigation projects, but when the Dothraki sacked them these were destroyed, and the surrounding desert expanded through the ruins. 

The Red Waste is not strictly speaking a true rolling sands desert, though it is a desert in the broad definition that it receives virtually no rainfall - more precisely, a rocky desert. It is actually far more harsh and dangerous than even a dry sandy desert, due to its low rocky hills, barren windswept plains, and dry riverbeds. It is more of a blasted wasteland than a simple sandy desert, which explains why it is known as the Red Waste and not simply the Red Desert. See also References
