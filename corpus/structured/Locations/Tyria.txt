 Tyria is a former city of the Valyrian Freehold. It was laid waste in the Doom of Valyria. Its ruins are now located on the same island as the ruins of Valyria itself, across the Smoking Sea from Oros.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/valyria\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Valyria entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-89880370756cca8cb98a43 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books
