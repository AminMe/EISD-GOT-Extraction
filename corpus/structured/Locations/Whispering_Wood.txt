In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels the Whispering Wood is northwest of Riverrun.
The first season HBO viewers guide showed the Whispering Wood to the north-west of Riverrun.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/the-whispering-wood\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Whispering Wood entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-133345030756cca8b3cc6f5 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / The second season map, however, positions it east of Seagard. data-rte-instance130814-133345030756cca8b3cc6f5 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / The initial Season 2 viewer's guide map seems to have been in error, because the HBO Viewer's Guide Battleground Westeros feature released later in Season 2 positioned Whispering Wood as immediately north-west of Riverrun, as in the books.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/map\/special\/battleground-westeros\/4\/ HBO Season 2 Viewer's Guide, \Battleground Westeros\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-133345030756cca8b3cc6f5 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /
