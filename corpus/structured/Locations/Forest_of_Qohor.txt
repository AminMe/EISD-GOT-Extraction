The Forest of Qohor is an extremely large area of woodland and forest on the eastern continent of Essos. It borders the Free Cities region to the east and the Dothraki sea to the northwest. The Shivering Sea lies to the north. It contains the headlands of the Qhoyne river.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/braavos\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Braavos entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-105256514656cca8d66dd62 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /
The Free City of Qohor is located on the forest's western edge. Despite its sheer size, the forest presents no significant obstacle to Dothraki khalasars, which can pass through the forest with impunity.

History
Season 1
The khalasar of Khal Drogo passes through the Forest of Qohor on its way from Pentos to Vaes Dothrak. Based on comments by Ser Jorah Mormont, it is possible that the immensely tall forest of reeds that Daenerys Targaryen orders the khalasar to halt in is part of the Forest of QohorLord Snow\/ref data-rte-instance130814-105256514656cca8d66dd62 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Forest of Qohor is traversed by Drogo's khalasar, taking half a month to pass through its eaves. The trees are huge, with barks as big as city gates and possessing leaves that give off a golden hue in the sunlight. Lemurs, spotted tigers, and great elks are found within the forest.
