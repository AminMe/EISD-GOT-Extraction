 In the books 
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Saltcliffe is the least noteworthy of any of the seven Iron Islands, without much of a distinguishing economy, culture, or history.
At least two major noble Houses are located on the island: House Saltcliffe of Saltcliffe, and House Sunderly of Saltcliffe. Balon Greyjoy's mother was a Sunderly - grandmother of Theon and Yara.
