It is a large, rich city-state of merchant lords. People from Pentos are known as Pentoshi. 

The city is the home of Magister Illyrio Mopatis. Daenerys and Viserys Targaryen temporarily reside in Pentos for about one year prior to Daenerys' marriage to Khal Drogo.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season1\/#!\/locations\/pentos\/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Pentos entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-83927623456cca85cddf51 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Geography 

Pentos is located at roughly the mid-latitude of the Free Cities, between Braavos in the north and Lys in the south. It is due east of King's Landing, directly across the Narrow Sea. It is surrounded by fertile coastal plains known as the Flatlands. Economy 

Pentos's economy is based mostly on trade and commerce of products such as cheese. As a result, Pentoshi traders like Illyrio Mopatis are often referred to derogatively as cheese-mongers. They have a brisk trade with the Seven Kingdoms across the Narrow Sea. They use their wealth to pay tribute to the Dothraki to avoid being sacked by the nomadic people.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/pentos\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Pentos entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-83927623456cca85cddf51 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Government

The Prince supposedly holds the powers of trade, justice, and war, and on every new year he must deflower the Maid of the Field and the Maid of the Sea to bring good fortune to the city. However, should a crop fail or a war be lost, the Magisters slit the Prince's throat and choose another. In truth, the Prince's power is only nominal, and the true rulers of the city are the council of magisters, wealthy merchant-princes.The Free Cities (Histories &amp; Lore)\/ref data-rte-instance130814-83927623456cca85cddf51 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Notable Pentoshi Illyrio Mopatis, a wealthy Magister of Pentos.

Ser Davos Seaworth tries to convince the pirate-lord Salladhor Saan to take a contract for his fleet of thirty ships to supplement the faction of Stannis Baratheon. Davos successfully wins over Salladhor by saying that he could spend the rest of his career making easy but small raids on the ships of Pentoshi cheese-mongers and Meereenese silk merchants, or he could help Stannis take King's Landing, which while more difficult will make Salladhor fabulously wealthy if they succeed.\The Night Lands\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-83927623456cca85cddf51 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Season 3

Pentos and the other Free Cities became independent over the course of the many-sided war known as the Century of Blood. 

Pentos is a large seaport consisting of squat brick buildings and a number of large palaces and holdings, both within the walls and outside on the plains known as the Flatlands. Pentos's location makes it especially vulnerable to raids from the Dothraki. As such the Pentoshi merchants are prone to feasting and gifting the passing Dothraki warlords with lavish parties and gifts to appease them into not destroying their holdings. 

Slavery is technically illegal in Pentos due to a treaty imposed by Braavos a hundred years before the events in the novels. However, the wealthy Magisters flout this law and keep bronze-collared servants that are slaves in all but name. Some Magisters are even involved in the slave trade. 

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, Pentos is pronounced PEN-tos, as opposed to Pen-TOES, etc. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
