The Bay of Seals is a large bay off the north-eastern coast of the continent of Westeros. It is part of the Shivering Sea. The bay runs from the wildling territories beyond the Wall to the Grey Cliffs north-east of Karhold. Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, the eastern-most castle on the Wall, is located on the edge of the bay. The Night's Watch controls the coast southwards for 150 miles (the eastern edge of the Gift). The coast south of that is controlled by House Umber. House Karstark controls much of the southern coast of the bay.
The islands of Skane and Skagos (amongst others) are located in the bay.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/castle-black\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Castle Black entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-114737029656cca8b6b8d49 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Bay of Seals is reported as being difficult to cross in autumn, as storms make it almost impassable. Ships risk being dashed against the rocky coastline of Skagos if they are not careful.
