After the politically arranged marriage of Lord Jon Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, and Lysa Arryn upon the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion, Petyr Baelish quickly capitalized on Lysa's former affection for him and persuaded her to have him appointed as controller of customs at Gulltown, the Vale of Arryn's greatest port. He exploited the war to increased the port's income tenfold.
