Old Ghis is a ruined city, located in the region of Ghiscar on the southern coast of Essos. It was once the ancient capital of the Ghiscari Empire, but was destroyed by the Valyrian Freehold with the use of dragons.\The Complete Guide to Westeros: Valyria and the Dragons\ featurette\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-139416002256cca8a34a4c4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Old Ghis led five great wars against Valyria before being destroyed once and for all. Frustrated by the city's constant uprisings, the Valyrians pulled down the city's walls, burned the buildings to ashes and cinders and poisoned the surrounding lands with salt, sulphur and skulls to prevent it from rising again. 

The city and the Ghiscari Empire were founded by Grazdan the Great, a mighty leader. Its symbol, and that of the Empire it led, was that of a harpy clutching a thunderbolt. Inspiration 

​Old Ghis has many similiarities with Carthage, the great rival of the Rome during its republican phase. The two empires engaged in three bloody wars. At the end of the last, the Romans destroyed the city and according to legend sowed the soil with salt to prevent the city rising again. See also (spoilers from the books) References
