 Background 

Stoney Sept was the site of one of the most important battles of Robert's Rebellion. Robert Baratheon hid in the town with the aid of the smallfolk. When the royal army arrived to search the town from house to house the bells of the local sept were rang, giving the ensuing battle its name: the Battle of the Bells. The arrival of Eddard Stark, Jon Arryn and Hoster Tully secured the rebel victory.Robert's Rebellion (Complete Guide to Westeros)\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-25154455856cca8c799f90 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Stoney Sept refers to a sept and its surrounding town. The sept itself sits on a hill. Below it is a holdfast made of grey stone that seems undersized for the town that surrounds it. The heart of Stoney Sept is a market square with a fountain in the shape of a leaping trout. Stoney Sept isn't nearly big enough to be considered even a minor city, but it is a fairly large market town. Arya Stark is brought there after she encounters the Brotherhood Without Banners, and notes that it is the biggest town she's seen since she left King's Landing.
