In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Redfort is the seat of the eponymous House Redfort, loyal and powerful vassals of House Arryn. House Redfort, like House Royce, is noted by Catelyn Stark as being descended from the First Men. 

Domeric Bolton was fostered at the Redfort for three years, and served as a squire to Lord Horton Redfort. See also References
