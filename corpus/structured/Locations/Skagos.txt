In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Skagos is nominally part of the North and is ruled by House Stark of Winterfell. However, in practice Skagos is located so far away from the centers of civilization that its inhabitants are virtually ignored and allowed to pursue their own customs and practices. According to myth, unicorns live on Skagos. There is a small kernel of truth to this, but the Skagosi Unicorn is essentially just an enormous one-horned species of goat. The island is mountainous, with treacherous currents surrounding it.
The people of Skagos are descendants of the First Men, who refer to themselves as Skagosi (stoneborn in the Old Tongue), although outsiders refer to them as Skagossons or, derisevely, Skaggs. Many centuries ago they sailed to Skane and depopulated the island, killing all of the men and taking the women back to Skagos as captives. Rumors by mainlanders say that the Skagosi are savage cannibals, who ate the people of Skane. They later fell under the authority of the King in the North, and then the Iron Throne. One century ago, the Skagosi rebelled and were defeated in a brief, bloody war that cost the life of the then-Lord of Winterfell and hundreds of his men. Nevertheless some Skagosi do business with the Night's Watch . They are also said to still enforce the tradition of First Night.
Skagos is also home to three noble houses:

House Magnar of Kinghouse
House Crowl of Deepdown
House Stane of Driftwood Hall
