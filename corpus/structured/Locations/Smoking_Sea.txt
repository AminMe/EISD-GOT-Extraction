The Smoking Sea is a body of water located immediately to the south of the Valyrian Peninsula, on the south coast of Essos. It is part of the ocean known as the Summer Sea. The Smoking Sea separates the numerous islands that were formerly part of Valyria from one another and the mainland to the northhttp:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/valyria\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Valyria entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-102416908556cca88e49063 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

History
Season 2
Quaithe of the Shadow Lands inscribes a sailor with apparently magic tattoos.

Season 5
After kidnapping Tyrion Lannister in Volantis, Jorah Mormont steals a fishing boat and heads east to Meereen in Slaver's Bay to present him as a gift to Daenerys Targaryen.  Jorah takes the boat through the Smoking Sea as a shortcut, and as he explains to Tyrion, because even pirates are afraid to approach the waters around Valyria, so they won't get any trouble from them on that route.  Along the way, they are attacked by Stone Men exiled among the ruins.\Kill the Boy\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-102416908556cca88e49063 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the Song of Ice and Fire novels the Smoking Sea is ill-omened. Its waters are said to bubble and let off foul vapors and mists which can kill sailors outright. The Smoking Sea is a recent phenomenon, formed four hundred years ago during the Doom of Valyria when the peninsula was shattered by a massive series of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
The Smoking Sea is considered cursed and haunted. Most sailors refuse to sail its waters, instead circumnavigating Valyria by taking a wide detour out to sea.
