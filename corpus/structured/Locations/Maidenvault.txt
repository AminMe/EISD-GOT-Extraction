The Maidenvault is a structure within the Red Keep. It was built under orders of King Baelor Targaryen to imprison his sisters Daena, Elaena, and Rhaena. While under Targaryen custom Baelor was expected to marry one of his sisters, he had them all locked away in the tower due to his extremely zealous piety, claiming this would keep him safe from carnal temptations.The Red Keep (Histories &amp; Lore)\/ref data-rte-instance130814-126262974756cca8d731be9 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Maidenvault was so-called because of the three maiden princesses imprisoned there. It is a long, slate-roofed building located behind the royal sept within the Red Keep. Its entry has two tall carved doors. Due to their imprisonment, the three sisters Daena, Elaena, and Rhaena became popularly known as the Three Maidens in the Tower.
While his father was still alive, Baelor had actually been made to marry his eldest sister, Daena. While the wedding ceremony was held, the marriage was never consummated, and after his father died Baelor had it officially annulled.
