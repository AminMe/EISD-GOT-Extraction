Gods Eye is an immense lake, the largest inland body of water in Westeros. It is located in the heart of the continent, in the southeast of the Riverlands. Small fishing villages dot its shores, but the most significant settlement is the ill-omened castle of Harrenhal, located on the north shore.
Gods Eye feeds a river which is a tributary of the Blackwater Rush. The Isle of Faces is located within Gods Eye.

History
Season 1
Tywin Lannister tells his son Tyrion Lannister that following the destruction of the western Lannister army-group in the Riverlands at the Battle of the Whispering Wood, the eastern Lannister army led by Tywin himself will fall back from the location of the Battle of the Green Fork and regroup at Harrenhal, on the north shore of Gods Eye lake. Tywin specifically says that to cover the retreat of the main army, he is sending out Ser Gregor Clegane and his riders to set fire to the farms and fields of the Riverlands everywhere between the Red Fork of the Trident river and Gods Eye lake.\Fire and Blood\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-196088952956cca8900ca11 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Isle of Faces is reputed to be located in the center of Gods Eye, the home of greenseers who keep the traditions and secrets of the long-vanished Children of the Forest. The island is said to be home to many weirwood trees. The Isle has a fell reputation and most avoid it.
Gods Eye feeds a tributary of the Blackwater Rush, but does not appear to be navigable by large ships. Another river, the Rippledown Rill, also feeds the lake.
