In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Myr has a reputation for great craftsmanship. The mirrors, lenses and other glassware produced in the city have no equal- a clear pane of good Myrish glass is worth its weight in spices. Myrish textiles- including intricate lace and finely woven carpets- are much sought-after products. The city even produces a signature drink- a sweet green wine known as green nectar. Myr also possesses a strong military, with its crossbowmen being particularly famed. Like most of theFree Cities,Myr is heavily involved in the slave trade, with slaves outnumbering freeborn citizens three to one.The city is ruled by a council ofMagistersand has its own language derived fromHigh Valyrian. 

The early history of Myr is something of an enigma. In its present form, the citywas founded as a colony of theValyrian Freehold, but there is evidence to suggest that human settlement in this location dates back to theDawn Age. The Myrish are also noted for being dark-haired and dark-eyed with olive-colored skin,and are considered exotic-looking by Westerosi standards. This has led some to theorize that the Myrish may be related to theRhoynarpeople- who possessed similar coloring- but this has not been conclusively proven. 

After theDoom of Valyria, Myr became independent but was conquered a few years later by Volantis, which was trying to rebuild the fallen empire. When Volantis overreached and attacked Tyrosh as well, its forces were beaten back and defeated by a coalition that included the Westerosi Storm King, troops from Pentos and Braavos as well as massive uprisings in Myr andLys. Volantis's military power was broken and Myr again became an independent city-state. 

These alliances, however, soon fell apart. As a result,Myr and Lyshave been perpetually warring with each other for the better part of the past three hundred years. The Disputed Lands between Myr to the north and Lys to the south are so-called because they are constantly changing hands between the two cities according to the outcomes of their conflicts. Tyrosh and Volantis have been drawn into this feud from time to time, allying with either Myr or Lys as the alliances shift. 

According to the Game of Thrones RPG, Myr is pronounced Mire, and uses the adjective Mire-ish. However, in Season 3 Thoros (of Myr) pronounces it as Meer (rhymes with deer). See also (spoilers from the books) References
