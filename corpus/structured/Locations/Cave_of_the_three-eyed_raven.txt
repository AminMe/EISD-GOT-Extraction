The cave of the three-eyed raven set was built by repurposing and completely redecorating the Dragonstone set. Given that Stannis Baratheon and his followers leave for the Wall in the Season 4 finale, the production team didn't need to keep the set as Dragonstone afterwards.http:\/\/www.denofgeek.us\/tv\/game-of-thrones\/243771\/67-things-you-didnt-know-about-game-of-thrones-season-4 \/ref} data-rte-instance130814-99684651256cca876ceed7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / In the books

The Lands of Ice and Fire map collection places it within the Haunted Forest, east of the Fist of the First Men and somewhat near the headwaters of the Antler River. Very loosely, if one draws a line straight east from the Fist of the First Men, and another line straight north from Craster's Keep, the cave is in the general area where the two lines intersect. Logically, it isn't as drastically far north as the distant northern edge of the map or the mountain valley of the Thenns - the crippled Bran Stark and his companions could not have traveled such a vast distance on foot. 

The cave is actually a great cavern under a wooded hill, deep within a system of caves. The three-eyed crow is seated on a weirwood throne in the great cavern, by an abyss, attended to by the remaining Children of the Forest. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books)
