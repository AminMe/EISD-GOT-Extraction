The Blackwater Rush, also called the Blackwater or River Blackwater, is a significant river of Westeros. It flows out of the hills and valleys of the Westerlands and proceeds eastwards for several hundred miles before flowing into Blackwater Bay. The city of King's Landing overlooks the mouth of the Blackwater. A tributary of the Blackwater feeds the lake of Gods Eye to the north.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/kings-landing\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, King's Landing entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-52086087056cca8bf3975e classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /
