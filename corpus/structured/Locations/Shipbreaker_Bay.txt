Shipbreaker Bay is a body of water located off the south-eastern coast of Westeros. It is an inlet of the Narrow Sea, running along the eastern coast of the Stormlands, separating the mainland from the island of Tarth. The bay is noted for its severe, frequent storms. House Baratheon's ancestral castle, Storm's End, is located on the bay.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season1\/#!\/locations\/kings-landing\/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, King's Landing entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-18040040056cca8c451770 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Shipbreaker Bay is named for the hundreds, if not thousands, of ships that have been wrecked in storms along its shores. Most notably, the parents of Robert, Stannis and Renly Baratheon were killed in a shipwreck close to Storm's End twenty years before the events of the series.
As well as Storm's End, the castles of Griffin's Roost, Rain House, and Evenfall Hall are located along the coast of the bay.
