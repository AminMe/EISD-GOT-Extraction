In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ny Sar was ruled by Princess Nymeria before the defeat of the allied Rhoynar city-states by the Valyrians. After their armies were defeated, Nymeria led an exodus of her people from all the lands of the Rhoynar, fleeing into the Summer Sea and thence to Westeros, where they landed in Dorne and allied with House Martell, helping them become the dominant power in the region.
