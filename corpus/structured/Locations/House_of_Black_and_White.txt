The House of Black and White is a temple in Braavos dedicated to the Many-Faced God. It also serves as the headquarters of the guild of assassins known as the Faceless Men. It sits alone on a small island in the lagoon of Braavos. Although can be reached by boat or bridge from other locations in the city, the island is usually deserted. Structure 

The sole entrance to the temple is a door, one half ebony, the other pale weirwood - thus one black door and one white door. Sanctuary 

The interior of the House features a central sanctuary with a large pool in the center. The water filling the pool is poisoned, and is given out to those who are suffering and come to the temple to seek the release of death. 

The sanctuary is lined with statues of many gods from many different faiths, from across both Essos and Westeros. Specifically they are gods that represent death and the unknown, such as the Stranger from the Faith of the Seven. The Faceless Men believe that all of these death gods are really one god who has revealed Himself to humanity in different ways: the Many Faced God of Death.\High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-29877412956cca84885235 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

Statues of deities represented in the sanctuary include: The Stranger from the Faith of the Seven A weirwood face, of the kind carved into heart trees to honor the Old Gods of the Forest The Drowned God of the Iron Islands The fiery heart of the Lord of Light The Black Goat of Qohor The Lion of Night from Yi Ti The Weeping Woman of Lys Hall of Faces 

 The deepest level of the House of Black and White is the Hall of Faces, an enormous vault with stone pillars, where the faces of the hundreds who die in the House of Black and White are kept to be employed as the basis for the face-changing abilities of the Faceless Men. History 

 Season 5 

Arya Stark is brought to the House of Black and White upon her arrival to Braavos. She is turned away by the building's doorkeeper, a priest, but remained in the vicinity for several days hoping to be let in. After a very brief stint as a street urchin, the doorkeeper retrieves her and allows her entry into the House.\The House of Black and White\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-29877412956cca84885235 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

Jaqen allows Arya to train as a Faceless Man, as long as she can become no one, which means ridding herself of all things that belong to herself. Arya throws her possessions into the ocean, except for her sword, which she hides in the beach rocks. The Waif, believes Arya to not be ready, however Jaqen implies whether or not it is all the same to the Many-Faced God. Her training is slow, to only cleaning the temple and washing the bodies of the dead. She is unknowingly tested into playing the game of faces, which she does not understand at first but slowly learns what it means to become no one. After passing Jaqen's game, she is allowed into the Hall of Faces, then she is given a task to assassinate a gambler who works at the docks. 

Arya gives up on her contract as she spots Meryn Trant, one of Arya's personal targets. She lies to Jaqen and continues to follow Trant. Arya takes a face from the hall and uses it to disguise as one of Trant's underaged brothel victims. As Trant dies, Arya reveals herself to him. 

After returning the face to the hall she is caught by Jaqen and the Waif. Trant's life was not hers to take, and as punishment, only death can pay for life. Jaqen drinks poison that Arya thought was meant for her and dies. Arya is horrified by the death of her friend, only to find out that the waif was now Jaqen. He explains that Jaqen was no one, something that Arya compromised for herself. Arya removes the dead Jaqen's face to find even more faces underneath. Jaqen was never a real person, just a face. And faces can only be used by those who are no one. To someone, a face is poison, and Arya Stark is rendered blind. Image gallery

The Hall of Faces was actually built as a fully realized set: instead of making one pillar slightly taller than the actors filled with masks and then doubling it up digitally, multiple pillars over thirty feet tall were built to fill out the entire room. The production team even invested the time and resources to make fully 600 individualized faces masks in this set, each unique and handcrafted.https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?vYrNiER8xWWE \/ref data-rte-instance130814-29877412956cca84885235 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the House of Black and White sits upon a rocky knoll made of dark grey stone. It has no windows and has a black tile roof. Its wooden doors are twelve feet high and carved. The left door is weirwood, the right ebony. In the center of the doors is a carved moon face ebony on weirwood, weirwood on ebony. Its grey stone steps lead down to the dock. 

In the novels, the left door at the entryway is made of white weirwood, and the right side door is made of black ebony. The TV series reversed this, for unknown reasons, so that the right door is white and the left door is black. 

In the center of the main room on the main floor lies a pool ten feet across. Statues of gods stand around the room. There are statues of thirty gods in all. Among them are the Weeping Woman, the Lion of Night, Hooded Wayfarer, Bakkalon, the Moon-Pale Maiden, the Stranger, and the Merling King. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
