In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Titan of Braavos is a massive stone and bronze statue that guards the entrance into the lagoon where Braavos is situated. It is the primary line of defense for Braavos and lets out a loud blast whenever a ship approaches the entrance to warn the Arsenal of its coming.
The Titan is listed as one of the nine Wonders Made by Man in the eponynous book written by explorer Lomas Longstrider.
It bears a strong resemblance to the Colossus of Rhodes. Listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World, it was destroyed during an ancient earthquake.
