In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Rills are a region of hills, lakes and rivers south-west of Torrhen's Square and north-west of Barrowton. House Ryswell holds the Rills for the Starks of Winterfell.
The Ryswells are noted for their honor. According to legend, a previous lord of the Rills arrested his own son for deserting the Night's Watch, returning him to the Wall for trial and execution. The same lord later took the black himself to help amend for his son's treachery.
