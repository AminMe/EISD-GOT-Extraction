The White Knife is a river in the North. It consists of two rivers, one originating in Long Lake and the other in hills to the east, which come together north-east of Winterfell. The river runs south into the Bite, with the city of White Harbor located at its mouth.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/Moat_Cailin\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Moat Cailin entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-24811788356cca8e7a8570 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels the White Knife has two branches, one originating in the Lonely Hills and the other in Long Lake. The White Knife is the primary waterway of the North and one of its most important methods of transportation.
A separate tributary originates in the west, near the edge of the Wolfswood and Winterfell, but it is not part of the White Knife itself.
