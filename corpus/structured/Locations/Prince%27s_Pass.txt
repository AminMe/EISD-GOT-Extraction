In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Prince's Pass is a natural choke-point in times of war, and prevents easy access for armies from other parts of the continent into the Dornish interior. The military value of the pass was even enough to stymie Aegon the Conqueror's invasion of Dorne, with his dragons unable to be deployed effectively against an enemy fighting from behind rocks and in ambushes.
Daeron I, the Young Dragon, used this to his advantage when he invaded Dorne one and a half centuries later. After sending an army into the pass, drawing the Dornish forces out to defend it, he landed a substantial second army by sea at the mouth of the Greenblood River, effectively outflanking the entire nation and compelling the Martells to surrender.
Ninety years before the events of the novel, a bandit lord known as the Vulture King seized control of the northern part of the Prince's Pass. Houses Caron and Dondarrion made an alliance and sent troops into the pass to root out the Vulture King. Duncan the Tall accompanied this expedition.
House Fowler of Skyreach serves the Prince of Dorne as the Wardens of the Prince's Pass, and are entrusted with its defense.
