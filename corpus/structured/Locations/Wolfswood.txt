 History 

 Season 1 

Bran Stark is attacked by wildlings (one of them being Osha) in the Wolfswood, before being rescued by Robb and Theon.\A Golden Crown\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-51661114856cca891726b5 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Wolfswood is so-named for the numerous wolves that live within its eaves. The forest is settled by crofters, foresters and hunters. House Glover of Deepwood Motte controls much of the territory of the Wolfswood. Sub-vassals of the Glovers who also live in the Wolfswood include House Forrester, House Woods, House Branch, and House Bole. Despite these woodsmen, overall the forest is thinly populated, wild and untamed. References
