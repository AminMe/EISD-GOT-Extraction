Located on the banks of the river Mander, Highgarden sits astride the Roseroad, a major thoroughfare linking Oldtown and King's Landing. Highgarden also forms the southern terminus of the the Searoad, which leads to Lannisport. As King's Landing, Oldtown, and Lannisport are the first, second, and third largest cities in the realm, heavy trade and traffic across a large swath of southern Westeros ultimately passes through Highgarden. History 

 Background 

Highgarden was founded by Garth Greenhand, one of the legendary kings of the First Men. His descendants, House Gardener, ruled from Highgarden as Kings of the Reach until the invasion of Aegon the Conqueror. King Mern IX Gardener and all his issue were slaughtered by Aegon's dragons on the Field of Fire, and his steward Harlen Tyrell yielded the castle to Aegon. In gratitude, Aegon bestowed Highgarden on the Tyrells and named them Lords of the Reach. This sparked off a long-standing complaint from House Florent of Brightwater Keep, who claimed a superior blood-link to the Gardeners, though this has been constantly dismissed by later kings.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season1\/#!\/locations\/highgarden\/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Highgarden entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/highgarden\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Highgarden entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/highgarden\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Brightwater Keep entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Season 2 

During the tournament held by King Renly Baratheon, when Ser Loras Tyrell duels with Brienne of Tarth, Margaery Tyrell cheers on her brother by standing up from her seat and shouting Highgarden!.\What is Dead May Never Die\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

After Renly is assassinated, most of his bannermen from the Stormlands submit to his older brother Stannis Baratheon. However, Margaery and Loras withdraw House Tyrell's sizable army back to Highgarden, along with the other Houses from the Reach they command.\The Ghost of Harrenhal\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / A few Tyrell bannermen, however, bend the knee to Stannis.Season 2 Bluray: War of the Five Kings feature\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Season 3 

Cersei and Joffrey attend a dinner with Margaery and Loras. To win the support of the smallfolk of the city, Margaery has been giving out food aid with her handmaidens - Cersei is unsettled because while she only knows how to rule through fear, Margaery is adept at winning the hearts and minds of her people, a skill which Cersei lacks. Indirectly mocking Cersei, Loras pointedly says that Margaery has previously been greatly involved with charity work for the poor back at Highgarden. Cersei also mocks Margaery's revealing dress by sarcastically asking if she is cold, to which Margaery counters that the climate is warmer in Highgarden - though thankfully, the Tyrells' blood runs quite warm.\Valar Dohaeris\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

When Margaery introduces Sansa to her grandmother Olenna Tyrell in the gardens of the Red Keep, Olenna scoffs that her son Mace Tyrell was a fool for supporting Renly Baratheon's attempt to claim the throne. After admitting to Olenna that Joffrey is a psychopathic monster, Sansa fears that this will mean Joffrey won't marry Margaery, and will instead force her to marry him as before. Olenna reassures Sansa that Mace, whom she calls the Lord Oaf of Highgarden, is too deeply set on having his daughter Margaery be Joffrey's queen to call off the wedding no matter what.\Dark Wings, Dark Words\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Season 4 

When Jaime Lannister returns to King's Landing, Cersei enumerates the many grievances she has suffered in his absence, and voices her extreme displeasure at Joffrey marrying Margaery, whom Cersei deems a wicked little bitch from Higharden.\Two Swords\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Season 5 

After Tywin Lannister's murder, Loras presumes that the arranged marriage between himself and Cersei will be canceled, given that Tywin was the one pushing for it. He tells his sister Margaery that he is not happy to be free of the match, however, because it means that instead of Cersei returning with him to Highgarden as originally planned, she will now remain in King's Landing and undermine Margaery at every turn. Margaery wryly implies that while Cersei will be staying, she won't find undermining Margaery to be that easy.\The Wars to Come\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Notable residents of the castle Lady Olenna Tyrell, known as the Queen of Thorns, the dowager-lady of the house.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire\/i,link:A Song of Ice and Fire,wasblank:false,noforce:true,wikitext:A Song of Ice and Fire|A Song of Ice and Fire data-rte-instance130814-96930687156cca859acbdf href/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire title=A Song of Ice and FireA Song of Ice and Fire novels, Highgarden is among the most beautiful castles in the Seven Kingdoms. Situated on a broad, symmetrically shaped hill, the castle includes three concentric tiers of white stone walls, which increase in height and thickness as one travels upwards. Between the outermost and middle walls is Highgarden's famous briar maze, a labyrinth of beautifully maintained hedges that serves two important purposes; entertainment for the castle's inhabitants and deterrence against enemies (any invaders who manage to penetrate the outer wall would have no easy task finding their way through the elaborate growth of thorns and greenery). 

The inner rings of Highgarden are a beautiful complex of towers, courtyards, colonnades and statuary, and greenery is just as prominent inside the walls as in the fields outside; ivy, grapevines and climbing roses can be seen snaking around the buildings, and gardens and arbors are filled with flowers. Water features are also common inside the walls, with pools, fountains and even man-made waterfalls visible throughout the complex. 

Highgarden is also notable for its places of worship. The castle sept is lined with rows of stained-glass windows depicting the Seven as well as Garth Greenhand, the legendary first king of the Reach. Highgarden's godswood, instead of the typical single heart tree, contains three tall weirwood trees known as the Three Singers. Said to have been planted by Garth himself, the branches of the trees have become so enmeshed over the centuries that they resemble a single tree with three trunks. 

A fine selection of horseflesh can be found in Highgarden's stables, and pleasure barges offer river cruises on the Mander. Outside the walls, meadows and fields of flowers can be seen in every direction, along with fruit orchards rich in peaches, melons and fireplums. See also References
