Though culturally still identifying itself as Ghiscari, Astapor is an independent city-state and is not aligned with New Ghis, which seeks to restore the Ghiscari Empire, to the south. 

The flag of Astapor bears the Ghiscari harpy holding between its talon a chain with open manacles on both ends. 

People and things from Astapor are known as Astapori. History 

 Season 2 

While in Qarth, Ser Jorah Mormont informs Daenerys Targaryen that he has procured transport on a ship bound for Astapor. However, Daenerys refuses to leave without having first recovered her dragons from the House of the Undying.\The Prince of Winterfell\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-79703036656cca86640ec4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Season 3 

Daenerys is convinced to travel to Astapor to procure the services of the eunuch slave-army known as the Unsullied. In Astapor she is nearly assassinated by the use of a manticore, but is saved by Ser Barristan Selmy, who pledges his service to her.\Valar Dohaeris\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-79703036656cca86640ec4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

Daenerys later visits the Walk of Punishment, where slaves who have committed transgressions are tortured and put on display as a warning to others. Daenerys attempts to comfort a slave who has been condemned to death with water. He instead begs her to be allowed to die.\Walk of Punishment\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-79703036656cca86640ec4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

After purchasing the entirety of Unsullied of Astapor, as well as the slave-boys still in training to become Unsullied, Daenerys double crosses the Good Masters. Under her command, the Unsullied put all slaver masters in the city to the sword, sparing only the children, and liberate the slaves, while Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal are also unleashed.\And Now His Watch is Ended\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-79703036656cca86640ec4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / 

While meeting with Razdal mo Eraz outside of Yunkai, Daenerys demands the release of every slave in the city or she and her army of Unsullied will take it by force. Highly offended, Eraz spits back that Yunkai is not Astapor or Qarth, and that the Yunkai'i have powerful friends who would take great pleasure in bringing Daenerys down.\The Bear and the Maiden Fair\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-79703036656cca86640ec4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext / Season 4

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Astapor, like its sister-cities of Yunkai and Meereen, is culturally and historically Ghiscari in origin, until the defeat of the old Ghiscari Empire by Valyria thousands of years ago. Following the Doom of Valyria, Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen have reestablished their Ghiscari traditions, but have not joined the resurgent Ghiscari nation based at New Ghis. 

Astapor is located at the mouth of the Worm River. It is ruled by the Good Masters, slave-owners and traders who have become immensely wealthy. They live on large, stepped pyramids similar to those in Meereen, but not as large. It is called the Red City for the red brick its buildings are made of. The city contains fighting pits and slave markets. 

Slaves who displease their masters are tortured and displayed in the Plaza of Punishment, which is the first place a new slave brought into the city sees. 

The trade of slaves is usually conducted in the Plaza of Pride, an open market where the slavers take their customers to view their purchases. In the center of the plaza stands a red brick fountain with a hammered bronze version of the Astapori harpy standing in its center. 

Of the three slaver-cities, Astapor is bigger than Yunkai, but Meereen has a bigger population than Astapor and Yunkai put together. The population of Astapor is not as big as that of Qarth or Pentos. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
