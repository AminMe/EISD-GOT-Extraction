In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Wendish Town is sacked at the outset of the War of the Five Kings. Lannister raiders slip across the border and attack the town. The inhabitants retreat to the holdfast, but the raiders burn it. As the townsfolk flee, they are shot down with arrows. 

The town is noted as the home of the popular song On a Misty Morn, one of the songs in the repertoire of the bard Marillion. See also (spoilers from the books) References
