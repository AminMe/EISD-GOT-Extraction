In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Spears of the Merling King are named after the Merling King, a deity commonly revered by sailors. For every spear that breaks the surface a dozen more lie just beneath. For this reason, it is considered quite dangerous for any ship to sail into the Spears, as the hidden monts will rip the bottom of any passing vessel.
