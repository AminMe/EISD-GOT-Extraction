 Season 5 

Roose Bolton sends his recently legitimized bastard son Ramsay to Castle Cerwyn to collect taxes from his new vassals. Lord Medger Cerwyn, however, refuses to pay; proudly professing his loyalty to House Stark, and denouncing Bolton as a turncloak. For his defiance, Ramsay has Medger flayed alive, along with his wife, and brother, all the while forcing his son to watch the ordeal. When Ramsay relays these events to his father he casually remarks that the new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes. \High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-62043944956cca8c116847 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books
