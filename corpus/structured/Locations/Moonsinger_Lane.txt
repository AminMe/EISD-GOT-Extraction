History
Season 5
In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no mention of a Moonsinger Lane in Braavos or any other location. Nevertheless, the name is a reference to the Moonsingers, priestesses of the Jogos Nhai. Moonsingers were among the slaves that fled bondage under the Valyrian Freehold and led the way to the place where Braavos would be founded.
