It is the abode of Craster, a wildling who lives there with his daughter-wives. Craster permits the use of the keep as a refuge and resupply post by the Night's Watch in return for otherwise leaving him alone and the occasional bribe. The keep is large enough to host a garrison of men.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/crasters-keep\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Craster's Keep entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-158425486856cca86e9e959 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /

They also learn of Craster's many daughter-wives. Season 3

Themutineers remain at the keep, led by the violent and sadistic Karl. After his return to Castle Black, Jon Snow urges the Watch to attack Craster's and kill the mutineers before they reveal the Watch's weakness to Mance Rayder. Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt agree, expecting Jon to be killed in the attempt. However, a number of the brothers volunteer to join Jon, and the raid is successful, though several of the volunteers are killed, among them Locke, who was on a mission from Roose Bolton to find and kill Eddard Stark's remaining sons. After the mutineers are dead, Jon and his men burn Craster's Keep at the behest of one of Craster's wives.\First of His Name\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-158425486856cca86e9e959 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

Craster's Keep is not a true keep, but instead a log hall surrounded by an earthen dike, also consisting of a sheepfold, pigsty and midden heap. The hall itself is large enough to accommodate a few dozen people at any one time. Still, for Night's Watch rangers far out beyond the Wall, it's preferable to have a roof over their heads. 

The Keep sits atop a low hill which some of the black brothers jokingly wonder if its made of mud or Craster's feces. See also (spoilers from the books) References
