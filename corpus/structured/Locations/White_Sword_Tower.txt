In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the White Sword Tower is a slender, four story structure built into an angle of the Red Keep's wall overlooking the bay. A circular white room, known as the Round Room, has whitewashed stone walls hung with white woolen tapestries, and forms the first floor. A large white table - weirwood carved in the shape of a shield - with seven chairs provides a meeting space for the order. The undercroft holds arms and armor, the second and third floors the small spare sleeping cells of the six brothers of the Kingsguard, and the topmost floor is given over to the Lord Commander's apartments. His rooms are spare as well, but spacious, and they stand above the outer walls. The Tower also houses The Book of Brothers, also known as The White Book, in which the deeds of each member of the Kingsguard is recorded.
