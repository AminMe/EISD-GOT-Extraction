The Frozen Shore is the name given to the northern coastline of the Bay of Ice, located beyond the Wall in the far northwest of Westeros. It is inhabited by wildlings. It is separated from the Haunted Forest and the Wall by the mountain range known as the Frostfangs. The Skirling Pass links the Haunted Forest to the Frozen Shore. The Lands of Always Winter lie to the north.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/frostfang-mountains\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Frostfangs entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-79718248056cca88cab6e7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

People

The snows are so deep on the Frozen Shore, and there is so little plant life, that the wildling tribes that live there travel about by riding in sleds made from walrus bones, and pulled by packs of dogs.The Nations of the North\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-79718248056cca88cab6e7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Frozen Shore is inhabited by clans of warriors who ride chariots made out of walrus bone and pulled by dogs. The clans of the Frozen Shore warred incessantly with the Ice-river clans to their north, until the King-beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, negotiated a truce. Frozen Shore warriors now fight in his army.
The men of the Frozen Shore aren't too isolated from the other wildling tribes, despite living on the west side of the Frostfangs, because they can move along the coast to bypass the mountains.  Still, the lands they live in are harsh, and they survive mostly on resources from the sea.  
In the past, raiders from the Frozen Shore have raided Bear Island to the south.
