 Oros is a ruined city in Essos. The city is located at what used to be the meeting point of the Valyrian Peninsula and the Essosi mainland. The area immediately south of Oros was obliterated in the Doom of Valyria four centuries ago, creating the Smoking Sea. The ruins of Tyria lie across the sea to the south.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/valyria\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Valyria entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-69942038956cca8ae835b9 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Oros is connected by a Valyrian road to Mantarys. It was located close to the Fourteen Fires, the great volcanic mountain range stretching across the neck of the Valyrian Peninsula. Given its close proximity to the volcanoes, it was likely laid waste during the Doom. See also (spoilers from the books) References
