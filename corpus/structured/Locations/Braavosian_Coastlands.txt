In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Braavos is the most powerful city-state on the Narrow Sea, but is constrained by the geographic limitations of the city (located on a series of small islands in a lagoon). To overcome this, it is presumed that Braavos has established colonies and other settlements on the coastline to the south.
