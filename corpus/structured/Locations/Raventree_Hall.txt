In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Raventree Hall is ancient, dating back to the days of the First Men. The walls are covered in moss, with a tower at each angle in the wall. Two huge, square towers flank the gate. Inside the walls are an outer ward, a large timber keep and a godswood. The godswood contains a single weirwood of massive size. Hundreds of ravens roost on the dead weirwood, which is said to have been poisoned by the Brackens, the Blackwoods' ancestral foes. See also (spoilers from the books) References
