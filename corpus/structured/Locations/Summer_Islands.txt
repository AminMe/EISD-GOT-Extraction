<p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1"><i>The Lands of Ice and Fire</i>, a companion map collection for the novels released in 2012, revealed for the first time a full map of the Summer Islands and their orientation to the main continents in the story.  The Summer Islands are a large island chain curving along a northwest-to-southeast axis:  the northwestern-most of the islands is located due south from the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Narrow Sea","link":"Narrow Sea","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Narrow Sea]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Narrow_Sea" title="Narrow Sea">Narrow Sea</a> between Westeros and Essos, roughly at the same latitude as the southernmost tip of the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Valyrian Peninsula","link":"Valyrian Peninsula","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Valyrian Peninsula]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Valyrian_Peninsula" title="Valyrian Peninsula">Valyrian Peninsula</a> to the east.  Observing from a map, the northernmost of the Summer Islands is roughly the same distance south of the Stepstones as the distance that <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Braavos","link":"Braavos","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Braavos]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavos</a> is north of the Stepstones.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Because the island chain curves to the southeast, however, the southern islands are located farther away from Westeros:  the southernmost is roughly at the same line of longitude as <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Dagger Lake","link":"Dagger Lake","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Dagger Lake]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Dagger_Lake" title="Dagger Lake">Dagger Lake</a> in the Free Cities.  The entire archipelago is spread across a large area, loosely the same size as the Valyrian Peninsula (in width and height on a map).  The northwestern-most island is roughly equidistant between Westeros and Essos, while the southeastern-most island is roughly equidistant between Essos and mainland <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Sothoryos","link":"Sothoryos","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Sothoryos]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Sothoryos" title="Sothoryos">Sothoryos</a>. The island of <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Naath","link":"Naath","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Naath]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Naath" title="Naath">Naath</a> is the closest other land to the Summer Islands, to the east between the archipelago and Sothoryos.  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Further information was also given in the <i>World of Ice and Fire</i> sourcebook (2014).  There are three main islands in the chain, from north to south:  Walano, Omboru, and Jhala.  Walano and Omboru are each less than half the size of Jhala - but either of those two are still larger than the total land area of the Stepstones (so at a rough guess, the combined land area of the Summer Islands is over four times that of all the Stepstones combined).  There are about fifty islands in the whole archipelago, though many are so small that a man can walk across them in a single day and uninhabited.  Other than the main three islands only about a half dozen other smaller islands are also settled - nine out of every ten people in the Summer Isles live on the three main islands.  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">While Jhala is the largest island, Walano has the largest population (both in total numbers and density), boasting three major cities:  Tall Trees Town, Lotus Port, and Last Lament.  The only other major city indicated is Ebonhead, at the southwestern tip of Jhala - though, as with Westeros, there are apparently numerous large market towns throughout them which are smaller than full-fledged "cities".  All of the islands have a lush tropical climate filled with rainforests.  Many precious hardwoods, however, particularly goldenheart, don't grow on Walano itself, only on Omboru and Jhala farther south.  The sparsely populated interior of large Jhala is home to silverback gorillas, and various species of monkeys abound in the canopies of all the islands.  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The half-dozen smaller islands of appreciable size include Koj and the Isle of Birds (between Walano and Omboru); Xon, Doquu, and the Bones (in Parrot Bay south of Jhala); and spread out a long distance west from Omburu and Jhala are Moluu, the Isle of Love, the Singing Stones, and the Three Exiles.  Koj is disproportionately important because, while not one of the main three islands, three quarters of all of the large sea-going galleys in the Summer Islands are built in its dockyards.  Each of the smaller islands is ruled by its own independent prince (or princess); the main three islands are large enough to be divided between several rival princedoms.  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Official maps for the TV series, including the online HBO Viewer's Guide map, have not included the Summer Islands so far. The map which the TV series uses for Essos is actually slightly outdated, as it was produced before <i>The Lands of Ice and Fire</i> was released. The biggest differences are mostly in the far east, beyond Qarth and Vaes Dothrak: the TV series map assumed that Qarth is on the southern end of the Jade Sea, when <i>Lands of Ice and Fire</i> revealed that Qarth is actually located at the northern end of the Jade Sea.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Starting in <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Season 4","link":"Season 4","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Season 4]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Season_4" title="Season 4">Season 4</a>, the astrolabe map which appears in the opening credits of the TV series finally portrayed the Summer Islands for the first time, as the camera swings from Westeros to Slaver's Bay in Essos. The design, which only briefly appears, does not correspond to the map of the Summer Islands revealed in <i>The Lands of Ice and Fire</i>, which revealed that the northwestern-most of the islands is located at the same longitude as Tyrosh, and the same latitude as the southern end of the Valyrian peninsula. The TV series's opening sequence depicts the northernmost island as being located further to the northwest, nearly as far west as the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Red Mountains","link":"Red Mountains","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Red Mountains]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Red_Mountains" title="Red Mountains">Red Mountains</a> of Dorne, and nearly as far north as <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Volantis","link":"Volantis","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Volantis]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-140792416256cca86c74523" href="/wiki/Volantis" title="Volantis">Volantis</a> (which is located at the base of the Valyrian peninsula). This may have been done simply to fit them onto the screen, and not to specify actual distances, as the islands were viewed out of focus and at an angle as the "astrolabe" in the opening sequence swung around.
