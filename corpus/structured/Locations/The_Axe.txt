In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Axe is a mountainous headland, an extension of the hills and mountains to the south. Norvos maintains mines in this area. Ores are taken by land down to the Darkwash River and thence to Norvos and Qohor.
According to legend, the Andals inhabited the Axe before they migrated further west to Andalos.
