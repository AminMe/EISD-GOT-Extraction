In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Queenscrown was renamed after Queen Alysanne Targaryen stayed there. The tower's merlons were repainted in gold in honor of her visit. 

Queenscrown consists of a single tall tower located on an island in the midst of a lake. There is a causeway located just under the water, but its location is difficult to see. This makes attacking the holdfast difficult. A small village and inn used to lie on the shores of the lake near the holdfast. The holdfast has been abandoned out of fear of wildling raids from the north. While the village has long-since fallen into disrepair, the tower remains relatively intact. 

It is at Queenscrown (and not an abandoned mill as depicted on the show) that Bran Stark and his companions stay overnight as they waited for a storm to pass. While they waited, a man passing through arrived and stayed in the ruined village to wait out the storm too. Jon Snow arrived with the wildlings he was travelling with and they captured the man. Jon was ordered to kill the man, but balked and Ygritte killed the man anyway. 

Curiously, the map in HBO's Viewer's Guide does specify the location of Queenscrown, but no dialogue in The Rains of Castamere specified that this was the identity of the ruins where Bran's party took shelter. The Season 3 Blu-ray might provide more information in the future. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the book) References
