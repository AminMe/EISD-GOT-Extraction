</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1"><i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> sourcebook (2014) revealed for the first time a large amount of information about Lorath:  in its current form it was founded by a cult of religious dissidents from Valyria, who followed a god called Boash (though the cult died out hundreds of years ago).  Beecause their religion did not believe in <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"slavery","link":"Slavery","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Slavery|slavery]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-76432719356cca86bab5c9" href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, the city became a haven for runaway slaves from other parts of the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Valyrian Freehold","link":"Valyrian Freehold","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Valyrian Freehold]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-76432719356cca86bab5c9" href="/wiki/Valyrian_Freehold" title="Valyrian Freehold">Valyrian Freehold</a>.  As a result Lorath's population is noted for being ethnically quite mixed, much like <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Braavos","link":"Braavos","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Braavos]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-76432719356cca86bab5c9" href="/wiki/Braavos" title="Braavos">Braavos</a>.  This information wasn't available when the TV show changed Shae's backstory to be Lorathi, due to ethnically Turkish actress Sibel Kekilli being cast in the role:  the <i>World</i> book only came out in late 2014, <i>after</i> Shae died at the end of Season 4, and it wasn't even decided she was Lorathi until Season 2.   <b>Nonetheless, it actually fits quite well with the backstory about Lorath from the novels,</b> that people from Lorath tend to be ethnically diverse, even compared to the other Free Cities (much like Braavos).  This is in contrast with one of the more ethnically uniform Free Cities, such as <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Volantis","link":"Volantis","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Volantis]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-76432719356cca86bab5c9" href="/wiki/Volantis" title="Volantis">Volantis</a> (it is a plot point that the Volantene nobility pride themselves on their Valyrian ancestry, and look like Daenerys with pale white skin and silver-white hair, and don't intermarry with people from other ethnicities).  
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The <i>World</i> book established that because the cult of Boash believed in extreme self-denial, this led to an odd manner of speech among the ancient Lorathi, in which they only used indefinite pronouns, as another way of humbling their sense of self-worth.  For example, instead of a Lorathi man saying "I thank you, girl", he would only say "a man thanks a girl".  The cult of Boash died out hundreds of years ago, but even in the present day, as a cultural relic the upper aristocracy of Lorath still consider it a sign of good manners to use this speech pattern.  Thus the Faceless Man that Arya Stark encounters doesn't use this "a man thanks a girl" speech pattern because he is truly a Faceless Man of Braavos - Braavosi people do not speak this way.  The speech pattern is just part of his false "Jaqen H'ghar" persona - a convincing <i>imitation</i> of how a Lorathi man would talk.  The <i>World</i> book did emphasize that only some of the upper aristocracy in Lorath still use this speech pattern, however, so there is nothing incongruous with the fact that TV-Shae does not herself use this speech pattern despite being from Lorath.

<h3 data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">History</h3>
<p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">While the novels themselves have not revealed much about Lorath, <i>The World of Ice and Fire</i> sourcebook explained that this location actually has quite an extensive history. Long before it became a colony of the Valyrian Freehold, the area where Lorath now stands was home to a revolving door of cultures and peoples. Its earliest known inhabitants - dubbed the "mazemakers" by later generations - erected vast labyrinthine structures that still stand in the present day. Although the bones of these master masons have been discovered (they were larger than typical humans but smaller than Giants), the mazemakers themselves disappeared thousands of years ago and left no written records, so the truth about them and their mazes is unknown.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">In the centuries that followed, Lorath was inhabited by a race of fisherfolk who bore many similarities to the present-day Ibbenese. They were later displaced by the Andals, who invaded from the mainland to the south. These new arrivals set up a slew of small kingdoms and spent much time warring and quarreling amongst themselves. When the Andals launched an attack on the Valyrian colony of Norvos, located to the southeast, the Freehold sent a force of one hundred dragons and beat the invaders back. The "Scouring of Lorath" that followed razed the Andal kingdoms to the ground left no survivors.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Afterwards, Lorath remained uninhabited for many years, until settlers from Valyria itself arrived in the area. These were religious dissidents who followed the faith of Boash, also known as the Blind God. The Boash'i practiced an austere lifestyle of extreme self-abnegation, even more than the <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Bearded Priests of Norvos","link":"Bearded Priests of Norvos","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Bearded Priests of Norvos]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-76432719356cca86bab5c9" href="/wiki/Bearded_Priests_of_Norvos" title="Bearded Priests of Norvos">Bearded Priests of Norvos</a> (they did not consume flesh or drink wine).  The faith of Boash did believe that all humans are equal:  male or female, rich or poor, free or slave.  Therefore slavery was not practiced in Lorath, and it became a favored destination for runaway slaves fleeing from Valyria itself - the result of which is that somewhat like Braavos, Lorath has a very diverse ethnic composition, due to much of its population being descended from slaves the Valyrians took from across the world. 
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">The Boash'i continued to dominate Lorath for several centuries, but the number of the Blind God's devotees gradually dwindled - both due to new settlers moving into the city from Andalos and Ib, and descendants of the original settlers simply losing interest in it, as their priests became corrupt and more concerned with collecting wealth.  At some point before the Century of Blood (roughly four hundred years prior to the War of the Five Kings) the last of the old priests of Boash were wiped out and Lorath became a Freehold, like Valyria before it. In the present day, Lorath is nominally ruled by a triad of elected Princes, though a council of magisters wields the true power.  Lorath is now predominantly a fishing port, as the surrounding waters of the Shivering Sea are plentiful with salt cod, walrus tusks, sealskins and whale oil.  These resources have not made Lorath wealthy, though it is reasonably prosperous.  Overall Lorath is considered to be the least of the Free Cities in wealth, population, and influence.  It is also the most isolated, rarely trading far beyond its borders, instead preferring to trade with its immediate neighbors Braavos, Norvos, and Ib. 
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">"Lorath" is pronounced "LORE-ath", with the stress on the first syllable, as opposed to "Luh-WRATH", "L'wrath", etc. It uses a short "A" as in "wrath", but is pronounced as two distinct syllables, not slurred together as "Lore-uhth".
