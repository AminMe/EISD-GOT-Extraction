When Lord Tywin Lannister quizzes Arya Stark on where she is from, she says Maidenpool. Tywin realizes she is lying when she cannot identify House Mooton's sigil. She then admits to being from the North, but says that Barrowton is her home town. She identifies the arms of the ruling House Dustin accurately.\The Ghost of Harrenhal\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-25756816256cca8dea8dc7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Maidenpool is a port town on the east coast of Westeros, on the Bay of Crabs. It is linked to King's Landing by two roads, one that runs along the coast of Crackclaw Point to the east and another that passes directly south through Duskendale in the Crownlands. Fisherfolk northwest of Maidenpool fish the waters in leather coracles and collect clams. Maidenpool's main gate is called the Fool's Gate. 

Maidenpool is sacked during the War of the Five Kings. Jaime, Cleos Frey and Brienne pass through the town on their way to King's Landing, noticing that the town walls are deserted, the gates are smashed, and half the homes and shops are burned or plundered. After the Battle of Duskendale, Randyll Tarly marches on Maidenpool, takes the town and locks Lord William Mooton in a tower cell. Later he begins to rebuild the town while hunting the outlaws in the area. See also (spoilers from the books) References
