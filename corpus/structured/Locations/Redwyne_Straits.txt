In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Redwyne Straits are usually peaceful. They are a center of trade, with ships passing through the straits from the city of Oldtown and ports on the Arbor to all parts of Westeros and Essos, as well as the Summer Islands and Stepstones. In ancient times the straits were less safe, with the ironborn sometimes raiding as far south as their waters.
Towns such as Vinetown, Starfish Harbor and Ryamsport sit alongside it.
