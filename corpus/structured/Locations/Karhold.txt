It is located in the far east of the North, south of the Bay of Seals and inland from the coast of the Shivering Sea. 

The castle was founded by Karlon Stark, a younger son of the then-King in the North after he was rewarded with lands by his father for putting down a rebellion by House Bolton of the Dreadfort. The castle was then called Karl's Hold. Over the centuries Karl's Hold became Karhold, and the Karl's Hold Starks became House Karstark.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season-4\/episode-5\/map\/location\/26\/karhold HBO viewers guide, season 4: episode 5 map, Karhold entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-158463400756cca888b7ed1 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books
