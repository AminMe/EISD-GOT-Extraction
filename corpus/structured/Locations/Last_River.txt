The Last River is the northern-most major river of the Seven Kingdoms. It is located in the North. The river flows out of the foothills of the southern Frostfangs and eastwards through the lands of House Umber, past their main castle at Last Hearth. The river then turns southwards and empties into the Shivering Sea north-east of the Dreadfort. The lands of House Karstark lie to the north-east of the river and the lands of House Bolton to the south. The Kingsroad crosses the river on its way north to the Wall.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season1\/#!\/locations\/last-hearth\/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Last Hearth entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-210907003656cca906f1052 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/karhold\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Karhold entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-210907003656cca906f1052 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels the Last River is in the same location. It isn't the last river at all before the Wall (which is still several hundred miles to the north), as smaller bodies of water can be found (such as the lake at Queenscrown), but it is the last major river of any note.
