The Hightower is a massive lighthouse located in Oldtown, the oldest city of Westeros. It serves as the seat of House Hightower, proud and wealthy bannermen of House Tyrell of Highgarden. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Hightower is described as being 800 feet tall - a hundred feet taller than the Wall itself (though still not approaching the sheer scale of the Wall, which stretches from one side of the continent to the other). It is the tallest structure in all of Westeros. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books)
