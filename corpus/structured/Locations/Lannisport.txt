 Season 1 

When Lord Commander Jeor Mormont tells Tyrion Lannister that there have been disturbing reports from wildlings trying to flee south of the Wall that they have seen the mythical White Walkers, Tyrion dismisses the notion that these reports are real by saying that the fishermen of Lannisport also report seeing mermaids.\Lord Snow\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-100217132656cca8872fb7a classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

While trading barbs with Theon, Tyrion Lannister reminisces about the occasion during the Greyjoy Rebellion when Lannisport was attacked by the ships of House Greyjoy. Lord Balon Greyjoy's two brothers burned the Lannister fleet as it sat at anchor, prolonging the war until Lord Stannis Baratheon was able to bring the Royal Fleet around from the east coast of Westeros and smash the Greyjoy fleet in open battle. Tyrion recalls seeing the ships burning.\Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-100217132656cca8872fb7a classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

Lannisport is located just south of Casterly Rock and is a large and bustling seaport with a population of approximately 250,000, about half the size of King's Landing. It is the third-largest city in Westeros, after King's Landing and Oldtown. Cersei Lannister and her friends used to sneak into the city while young to see the sights.
