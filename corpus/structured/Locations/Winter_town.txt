In the A Song of Ice and Fire the winter town is formed by rows of small and neat houses built of log and undressed stone. Located at Winterfell's main gatehouse, the market square has wooden stalls for produce and goods and a well at its center. The local alehouse is the Smoking Log. The Kingsroad lies past the sprawl of castle and town, while the Wolfswood is two miles away. Hunting parties from Winterfell can avoid the winter town by taking the Hunter's Gate instead of the main gate. 

Its streets are muddy during summer, when four fifths of the homes are left empty. During wintertime, however, the winter town becomes filled with northmen from throughout the region, such as clansmen from the northern mountains. Some townfolk claim that Winterfell is warmed by a dragon which sleeps below the castle - really the castle was built over a series of natural hot springs. 

In the novels, the Winter town is burned by the men of House Bolton when they betray the Northmen led by Ser Rodrik Cassel during the attempt to liberate Winterfell from the House Greyjoy occupation led by Theon Greyjoy, as part of the Sack of Winterfell.
