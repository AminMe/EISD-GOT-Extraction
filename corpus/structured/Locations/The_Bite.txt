The Bite is a large bay located off the north-eastern coast of Westeros. It is an inlet of the Shivering Sea. It separates the southern coast of the North from the northern coast of the Vale of Arryn, with the Neck running along the western edge of the bay. The islands known as the Three Sisters are located within the Bite.
Several northern settlements are on the coastland of the Bite. The castle Widow's Watch is on a peninsula that projects into the northern mouth of the bay. The city of White Harbor lies at the estuary of the White Knife river on the northern edge of the Bite. The town Ramsgate lies at the estuary of the Broken Branch river.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/moat-cailin\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Moat Cailin entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-16604008956cca8e369e34 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /
