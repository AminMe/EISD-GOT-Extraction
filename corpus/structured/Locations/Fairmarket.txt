In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, while en route to the Twins, Robb Stark sends scouts to Fairmarket to see if he could cross the Blue Fork there, but they find the wooden bridge washed out. 

Three generations before the Targaryen Conquest, Harren Hoare's grandfather Harwyn Hoare conquered the Riverlands from the Stormlands. Harwyn had no fixed capital afterwards but was constantly on campaign enforcing his reign throughout this new conquests. Harwyn's son Halleck did reign from a new capital on the mainland, a modest castle tower-house at Fairmarket. Halleck's son Harren then had the great dream of building the greatest castle-seat in all of Westeros, Harrenhal - but it took decades to complete, so it is unclear if Harren continued to rule from Fairmarket or if he ruled from Harrenhal's construction site.
