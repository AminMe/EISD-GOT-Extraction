The Great Hall is a location within the Red Keep, seat of the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. In it stands the Iron Throne, the symbol of the power and authority of the King over all of Westeros. Within the Great Hall, the King, or his Hand, in the former's absence, holds court, receives petitioners and oversees official ceremonies.

 Characteristics 

The Great Hall consists of a large, cavernous room. Its entrance is made up of two huge bronze and wood doors. The Iron Throne sits on the opposite side, atop a raised dais climbed up to by two set of wide steps of rough black stone; small chairs may be placed when the King or the Hand is accompanied by members of the small council. The floor is made of different types of marble. Overhead is the towering vaulted ceiling, with massive arches and columns. On the right side of the Hall stands a raised gallery that connects to other areas of the Red Keep. To the left side of the Hall, several windows with stained-glass depictions of the seven-pointed star of the Faith of the Seven allow light to enter.
During the reign of House Targaryen, the walls of the Hall were decorated with the skulls of dragons, from the largest to the smallest one.\Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-163538250456cca89bb33bc classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / However, after Robert's Rebellion, the skulls were removed and moved to the cellars of the Red Keep. Vine motifs were placed as decorations of the Hall's columns and several candelabra placed to illuminate the place. Behind the throne, a tall stained-glass window depicting stags - the sigil of House Baratheon - was installed.
Following the demise of King Robert, his successor, Joffrey Baratheon, ordered the Hall to be further modified, as he desired the throne room's appearance to mirror the one it had during the time of the Targaryens. The vine motifs and candelabra are removed and replaced with large, metallic braziers constantly ablaze. The stained-glass window behind the throne is also replaced with one depicting the seven-pointed star in yellow and red - the colors of House Lannister.

After discovering the truth of Prince Joffrey's parentage and the death of King Robert, Ned sets up to remove Joffrey from the throne and give it to Stannis Baratheon, Robert's brother and true heir. Ned enters the Great Hall accompanied by Stark men-at-arms, Lord Baelish, Varys and men of the City Watch led by Janos Slynt, where Joffrey orders Ned to make the arrangements for his coronation. Ned gives Robert's will, naming him Regent and Protector of the Realm, to Ser Barristan Selmy. Queen Cersei breaks the letter and orders Ned to swear allegiance to Joffrey, only for Lord Stark to order the City Watch to arrest the Queen and her children. The City Watch, however, attack the Stark men-at-arms, while Ned himself is held at dagger point by Littlefinger.
After Ned's arrest and the purge of the Stark household, King Joffrey holds court to reward Janos Slynt for his service and grants him lordship over Harrenhal, thus making Slynt a noble. Then, Queen Cersei informs Ser Barristan that he is to be dismissed from the Kingsguard, replaced with Ser Jaime as Lord Commander and is to be granted a keep and servants. Ser Barristan rejects this treatment and removes his white cloak before bearing his sword, to the alarm of the remaining Kingsguard. Ser Barristan angrily throws down his sword and leaves. Afterward, Sansa Stark appears before the King to ask for mercy for his father, who is accused of treason.
