In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Tor is the seat of House Jordayne, one of the most powerful Dornish houses. 

In the novels, George R.R. Martin named this castle and its house as a tribute to fellow fantasy author Robert Jordan, author of the Wheel of Time series. Tor Books are the publishers of the Wheel of Time books and the head of House Jordayne is Lord Trebor (a palindrome of 'Robert'). See also References
