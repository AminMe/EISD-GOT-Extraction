Pyke is the stronghold and seat of House Greyjoy, located on the island of the same name, which is one of the seven major Iron Islands. The castle is the regional capital of the Iron Islands as a whole. Pyke is an ancient stronghold and the cliff it was built on has been eroded by the sea leaving the towers standing on stone stacks. The towers are connected by swaying rope bridges. The rocky moss covered stone at its base is not suitable for ships landing so traffic to the island flows through the nearby harbor town Lordsport.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/pyke\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Pyke entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-149577967556cca8719bc16 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /\The Night Lands\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-149577967556cca8719bc16 classplaceholder placeholder-ext src=data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Pyke is an ancient, storm-worn fortress built atop several rocky towers jutting out of the sea. It is connected to the main island by a treacherous-footed rope bridge, and defended by tall walls. 

Pyke was long considered impregnable, but during the Greyjoy Rebellion immense siege-ships commanded by Stannis Baratheon smashed the walls down with boulders, allowing ground troops to storm the castle. The onslaught was so severe that the first men through the breach, including Thoros of Myr and Jorah Mormont, suffered relatively few losses and were able to secure a bridgehead within the walls. 

According to The World of Ice and Fire (2014), officially, no one is sure if the island is named after the castle or the other way around. The Greyjoys claim that the island is named after their Pyke castle (after they came to dominate the rest of the island), while the smallfolk of the island say that it was always called Pyke, and the castle is named after the island. 

It isn't clear how Pyke came to be used as the special surname for bastards from the Iron Islands, i.e. before the Targaryen Conquest 300 years ago, the ironborn were ruled by other Houses who weren't from the castle or island of Pyke, such as House Hoare of Orkmont island. They may have used different bastard surnames before the Conquest. See also References
