During the War of the Five Kings, Stone Hedge is occupied by Lannister forces. Following the lifting of the Lannister siege of Riverrun at the Battle of the Camps, Robb Stark divides his host in two, one that invades the Westerlands under his personal command, and another under the command of Greatjon Umber, which liberates Stone Hedge as well as other castles west of the Red Fork.Season 2 bluray: \War of the Five Kings\ feature\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-159386402756cca8d347846 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books
