The Black Cells are one level of the dungeons of the Red Keep. They are reserved for prisoners accused of high crimes, such as treason. Cells are completely dark, with no possible light sources (except when gaolers enter with torches).
Varys has access to the Black Cells, but dons the guise of a gaoler to enter.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire books the Black Cells are the third level of the Red Keep's dungeons. On the upper level are cells with high narrow windows where common criminals are confined together. The second level has smaller, personal cells without windows for highborn captives. Torches in the halls cast light through the bars. The Black Cells themselves are smaller still and have doors of wood so that no light enters them; they are reserved for the most vile and dangerous prisoners. The fourth level is the one used for torture and none who enter leaves alive.
