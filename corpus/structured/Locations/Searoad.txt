The Searoad is a major highway in the Seven Kingdoms. It connects Casterly Rock and Lannisport in the Westerlands to the castle of Highgarden in the Reach. The Searoad passes through Crakehall and Old Oak. The road has to cross the Mander River to reach Highgarden, which is located on the southern bank of the river. At Highgarden the Searoad meets the Roseroad, which heads north and east towards King's Landing, and south to Oldtown.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season1\/#!\/locations\/casterly-rock\/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Casterly Rock entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-85062746156cca912926ae classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Searoad is in the same location. Curiously, the first four novels in the series label is the Searoad, as does the official map for HBO's TV series adaptation. However, the map accompanying the fifth novel, A Dance With Dragons, inexplicably labels it the Ocean Road. It's not clear if this is an alternate name, or a mistake in publication.
