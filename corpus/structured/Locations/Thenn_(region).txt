Ironically, it is actually one of the most pleasant and abundant regions beyond the Wall:  the sheltered valley is heated by local volcanic activity (somewhat like real-life Iceland), making it an island of greenery in the otherwise frozen wastes of the very far north.

None of the other wildlings retained any skill with metallurgy, and have to scavenge or trade for iron weapons.  The Thenns, however, do still have skill with making bronze weapons (from abundant copper and tin supplies in their valley).  While they are not as strong as steel, they are more reliable than the old and scavenged iron weapons some other wildlings have - in fact, most wildlings only have weapons made of wood, stone, and bone.

The Magnar of the Thenns, however, isn't so much a "king" as he is worshiped like a god.  The result is that the Thenns are the best-disciplined of the wildlings, following orders of clearly established leaders, and they are also usually the best equipped.
