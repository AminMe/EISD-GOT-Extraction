The famous Roman bridge of CÃ³rdoba in Spain was used as a stand-in for the Long Bridge of Volantis - though the real bridge was then augmented with CGI to make it look proportionately larger and to add buildings and markets atop it, as the Long Bridge is described in the novels. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Long Bridge joins the two halves of Volantis across the mouth of the Rhoyne. It is a great span with a road supported by massive piers that the Valyrians built at the height of their glory. Its gateway is an arch of black stone carved with sphinxes, manticores, dragons, and other strange beasts. The road is just wide enough for two carts to pass abreast. Buildings rise on either side of the roadway. One can buy almost anything in the shops on the Long Bridge. In the center of the bridge the hands of thieves and the heads of executed criminals are displayed. 

The Long Bridge is one of the known world's most famous megastructures. Lomas Longstrider included it in his list of the nine Wonders Made by Man. Other wonders in this list include the Wall in Westeros, the Titan of Braavos, and the great triple walls of Qarth. See also (spoilers from the books) References
