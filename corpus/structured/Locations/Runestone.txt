 Runestone is a castle in the Vale of Arryn. It is the seat of House Royce, an ancient House once ruled the Vale as the Bronze Kings of the Vale before the Andal Invasion. House Royce are now one of the major vassal houses holding fealty to House Arryn of the Eyrie. The castle is located east of the Eyrie, on the coast of the Narrow Sea. It is north of the city port of Gulltown.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season-5\/episode-1\/map\/location\/43\/runestone HBO viewers guide, season 5: episode 1 map, Runestone entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-124596240456cca87d03218 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / History 

The current head of House Royce and Lord of Runestone is Yohn Royce, father of Robar and Waymar Royce. The maester appointed to the castle is Helliweg and its master-at-arms is Ser Samwell Stone. Season 5 

Robin Arryn is sent to be fostered at Runestone, where Royce's men begin attempting to train him to use a sword, but he is miserably bad at it. Sweetrobin was over-sheltered by his mother Lysa for years, and has never swung a sword before - unlike most boys who are even younger than the 13-year-old Robin Arryn. Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark observe Sweetrobin tripping over himself in a practice yard, along with Yohn Royce. As Littlefinger and Sansa depart, Lord Royce promises that he will keep the boy safe, though he cannot promise his swordsmanship will improve.\The Wars to Come\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-124596240456cca87d03218 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Image gallery

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Royce proudly descends from the First Men, one of the very few of their Houses to survive the Andal invasion in the Vale. The head of House Royce wears ceremonial bronze armor covered in the rune symbols of the Old Tongue of the First Men, which are also featured on House Royce's sigil. It seems probable that Rune-stone was named after runes left behind by the First Men in the area. See also (spoilers from the books) References
