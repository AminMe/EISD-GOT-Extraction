In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Great Pyramid had been built as an echo of the Great Pyramid of Ghis, whose colossal ruins had once been visited by noted explorer Lomas Longstrider. Like its ancient predecessor, the Pyramid has thirty three levels, a number chosen intentionally, since it is considered sacred to the gods of the Ghiscari religion.
