 Ashemark is a stronghold in the Westerlands. It is the seat of House Marbrand, a noble house sworn to House Lannister of Casterly Rock. It is located close to where the Tumblestone river begins, southeast of the Crag and northeast of Casterly Rock.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\shemark\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Ashemark entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-135581849556cca8d801a93 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ashemark is the seat of House Marbrand. 

After the Battle of Oxcross opened up the northern Westerlands to Robb Stark's army, his forces easily captured Ashemark. For some reason, the TV series doesn't refer to a minor engagement at the Battle of Ashemark, instead referring to a Battle of the Yellow Fork taking place around the same point. It seems that they changed the name to avoid confusion with Ashford, which is a castle in the Reach. It's possible that the Yellow Fork is meant to be the tributary of the Tumblestone, which is itself a tributary of the Trident River system, with its three main forks also named after colors: Red, Blue, and Green.
