In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Flint's Finger is the stronghold of one of the two cadet branches of Clan Flint, also known as the First Flints. The other branch is based at Widow's Watch on the opposite coast of the North, and is arguably more powerful. Flint's Finger is noted for being built over towering cliffs, which the young Balon Greyjoy once scaled during a raid. See also References
