In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Fossoway of Cider Hall is commonly referred as the red-apple Fossoways, to differentiate them from the other branch of the house, the green apple Fossoways of New Barrel, who split from the red apples in 208 AL. After Stannis' defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, they bend the knee to Joffrey. 

Leonette Fossoway is married to Ser Garlan Tyrell, elder brother of Margaery and Loras Tyrell. References
