House Mallister of Seagard is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Tully of Riverrun. Their lands are north of Riverrun, along the west coast of the Riverlands on Ironman's Bay, and southwest of the Twins. The castle is near the headwaters of the Blue Fork of the Trident River. 

The Mallisters are longstanding enemies of the ironborn: Seagard was built as a defense against marauders from the Iron Islands.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season-3\/episode-1\/map\/location\/44\/seagard\/ HBO viewers guide, season 3: episode 1 map, Seagard entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-108363310256cca9626933a classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Mallister is one of House Tully's most loyal vassals. Lord Jason Mallister is noted as both a loyal vassal and also a close personal friend and ally of Lord Hoster Tully. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, the Mallisters defended Seagard from an ironborn assault. While the town and castle were damaged and severe casualties incurred, the ironborn suffered significant losses, with Lord Jason slaying Rodrik Greyjoy in personal combat. 

A slight change is that in the books their sigil is a silver eagle on a purple field, but in the TV series the field is blue. Members Lord Jason Mallister, the head of the family. Ser Patrek Mallister, his eldest son and heir. He attended the Red Wedding, and is one of the few guests who were taken alive by the Freys. Ser Denys Mallister, Lord Jason's elderly uncle, a member of the Night's Watch and commander of the Shadow Tower.
