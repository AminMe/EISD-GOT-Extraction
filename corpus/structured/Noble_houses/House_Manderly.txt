 House Manderly of White Harbor is a vassal house that holds strong fealty to House Stark of Winterfell. They control White Harbor, a seaport and the North's only city. Their sigil is a merman with a dark green beard holding a black trident. History 

House Manderly were once a powerful noble house in the Reach. Centuries ago they were driven out of the Reach and were given sanctuary and lands by House Stark in exchange for their promise of loyalty. The Manderlys still keep many traditions from the South. They are the richest House in the North through fish, grain and trade.\The North (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-69984900656cca95d0d245 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Members

In A Song of Ice and Fire, House Manderly was originally a major noble house of the Reach, overseeing rich lands along the River Mander. Due to an unspecified incident, they were disgraced and exiled from the Reach a thousand years ago. They were given a safe haven by the King in the North, and rose to rule over the city of White Harbor. As a result they are the only major House in the North that follows the Faith of the Seven instead of keeping to the Old Gods. They are noted as being fiercely loyal to the Starks. 

House Manderly also controls a considerable amount of choice territory in the North. While their seat is at White Harbor at the mouth of the White Knife river, their lands extend as far north and east as the Sheepshead Hills, where the headwaters of the Broken Branch river also begin. Apparently their lands extend all the way east to the line of the Broken Branch, as the castle of Ramsgate at the river's mouth is held by an as-yet-unnamed vassal house of the Manderlys. The lands ruled by House Manderly are bordered by House Hornwood north of the Sheepshead Hills, House Flint of Widow's Watch east of the Broken Branch river, and on the south by House Locke of Oldcastle (though it isn't clear if the Lockes are vassals of the Manderlys). The Manderleys' lands apparently extend west as far as the Kingsroad.
