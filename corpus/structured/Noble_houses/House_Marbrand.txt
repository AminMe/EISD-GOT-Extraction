In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Marbrand's are loyal vassals of House Lannister. Ser Addam Marbrand is a childhood friend of Jaime Lannister and a key officer in the Lannister army. 

House Marbrand is also closely tied to Lannisters through marriage: Jeyne Marbrand was the wife of Tytos Lannister and mother of all five of his children, including Tywin and Kevan. Thus all of the Lannister characters who appear in the TV series have some blood relationship with the Marbrands. Tywin's younger brother Tygett also married Darlessa Marbrand - Tygett died of a pox before the novels begin, and Darlessa is his widow, as well as the mother of his son Tyrek Lannister, a squire of King Robert who was cut from the series. 

â€‹Ahistoricalmember of the house is Ser Lorent Marbrand, a knight of the Kingsguard who served during the reign of King ViserysI and chose to side with Rhaenyra Targaryenduring the Dance of the Dragons. He later became Lord Commander of her Queensguard, succeeding SerSteffon Darklyn,before dying in the riots in King's Landing. See also (spoilers from the books)
