House Tarth is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Baratheon of Storm's End. The family controls the island of Tarth, which lies in the Narrow Sea just off the coast of the Stormlands. Their seat is called Evenfall Hall. 

House Tarth is ruled by Lord Selwyn Tarth, a widower. His sole surviving child and heir is Brienne, whom he dotes on. Brienne, a tall and broad-shouldered woman, prefers the lifestyle of a warrior to that of a typical daughter of a noble house, and is skilled at arms. 

House Tarth's heraldry consists of yellow suns on rose quartered with white crescents on azure. Their words are not known.

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Tarth has been a loyal vassal of the Baratheons for many generations. With King Robert Baratheon away at court and Stannis Baratheon serving as Lord of Dragonstone, the Tarths, like most of the Stormland houses, regard Renly Baratheon, the Lord of Storm's End, with greater loyalty and affection than his two brothers. 

Brienne is the oldest daughter of Lord Selwyn of Tarth. She had two younger sisters but they both died in the cradle. She had an older brother named Galladon, but he drowned when she was eight years old, leaving her as Selwyn's only surviving child and heir. In Season 5 of the TV series, Brienne does say that she is her father's only surviving child, apparently a nod to this fact from the books. 

After Renly dies, it isn't clearly stated whom Lord Selwyn and House Tarth officially support. Selwyn certainly didn't send troops to aid Stannis, but it's unclear if he bent the knee to Joffrey, outright lent his support to him, or simply adopted an isolationist stance, like Lord Gulian Swann.
