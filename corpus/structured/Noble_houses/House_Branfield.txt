House Branfield is a minor noble house from the south of Westeros. They were noted Targaryen loyalists. After the fall of House Targaryen, House Branfield lost all its lands and titles, with most of its members killed or exiled. Today, only one known member of House Branfield is still alive, Malcolm Branfield. History 

 Background 

House Branfield is a minor southern house. They fought for House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion, after which all of their lands and titles were taken from them. Elissa Branfield had married Gregor Forrester, heir to House Forrester of Ironrath, some time before the rebellion. She was torn between the loyalty of both houses, despite being married to Lord Gregor but ultimately chose House Forrester. Elissa's brother, Malcolm fought bravely along with his brothers during the war, but never married or fathered any children, ensuring the eventual extinction of the house. Since Elissa's daughter Mira is a lady in waiting to Margery Tyrell, it is possible that House Branfield was originally from The Reach (especially as the Tyrells were Targaryen supporters during Robert's Rebellion). http:\/\/www.telltalegames.com\/blog\/discussion\/86265\/ref data-rte-instance130814-38949548156cca97807dc4 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / ​Iron From Ice
