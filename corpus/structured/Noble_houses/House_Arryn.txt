House Arryn is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It has ruled over the Vale of Arryn for millennia, originally as the Kings of Mountain and Vale and more recently as Lords Paramount of the Vale and Wardens of the East under the Targaryen kings and King Robert Baratheon. The nominal head of House Arryn is Robin Arryn, the Lord of the Eyrie, with his mother Lady Lysa acting as Lady Regent until he reaches the age of majority.

Their lands are in the central-eastern region of the continent. Their seat is the Eyrie, ancestral seat of the Mountain Kings. House Arryn's sigil is a white crescent moon and falcon on a blue field. Their motto is As High As Honor.

At the start of the series, Lord Jon Arryn was killed in suspicious circumstances. His widow Lysa blamed House Lannister and sought refuge in the Eyrie. Despite her enmity towards the Lannisters, she has remained neutral in the War of the Five Kings and aims to use the forces of the Vale to defend Robin and the Eyrie if necessary.

History
Background
According to legend, the house was founded by Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight. He is said to have flown atop a giant falcon, landing on the topmost mountain of the Vale, and defeated the Griffin King, the last of the First Men Mountain Kings. Afterward, he took the Eyrie and became the first King of Mountain and Vale. His descendants continued to rule the Vale as Kings until the Targaryen conquest, and then as Lords Paramount of the Vale and Wardens of the East in the name of the Iron Throne.The Complete Guide to Westeros: House Arryn featurette, Season 1 Blu Ray boxsethttp://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/housesrryn/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Arryn entry The Eyrie is considered impregnable and defends House Arryn from the violent Hill tribes of the Mountains of the Moon.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Arryn is the oldest and purest line of Andal nobility. According to tradition, the Andals landed on the Fingers, an area of peninsulas, hills, and rivers on Westeros's eastern coast, six thousand years ago and helped conquer the Vale. Ser Artys Arryn's duel with the Griffin King is said to have taken place on the shoulder of the Giant's Lance where the Arryns later built the Eyrie.

During the Targaryen conquest, the Arryns planned to make a stand at the Bloody Gate, the only pass into the Vale, and gathered their armies there while the King of the Vale (also a young boy at this time) and his mother, the regent, took refuge in the Eyrie. Rather than risking a bloody battle, Visenya Targaryen simply flew her dragon Vhagar to the Vale and landed in the courtyard while the young king was at play. The king agreed to swear fealty to Aegon the Conqueror if Visenya allowed him to ride on Vhagar. She agreed, the bargain was upheld and the Arryns and their vassals became loyal subjects of the Targaryens.So Spake Martin, http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Bubonicon_Report/ Bubonicon Report

During the summer they rule over the Vale from the Eyrie, but during the winter they descend to the Gates of the Moon, a castle at the foot of the mountain. The Gates of the Moon have not appeared in the television adaptation.

Jon Arryn and Lysa Tully's son is called Robert not Robin in the books. This change was made to prevent confusion with Robert Baratheon or Robb Stark. George R.R. Martin approved this change, noting that Robert Arryn's nickname in the books, Sweetrobin, remains intact.

In the books, the Heraldry of House Arryn is specifically sky blue, but in the TV series it is simply blue (azure), like House Tully's heraldry.

The members of the House Arryn in the books are:
* Lord Jon Arryn, the former head of the family, now deceased.
** His first wife, Lady Jeyne Arryn, who died in childbirth. Their daughter was stillborn.
** His second wife, Lady Rowena Arryn, who died of a chill.
** His third and current wife, Lady Lysa, of House Tully. Currently the ruling lady of the Vale until her son comes of age.
*** Lord Jon's only surviving child and heir, Robert Arryn, the Lord of the Vale.
* Lord Jon's younger sister, Lady Alys, married into House Waynwood.
** Alys's eldest son, Ser Denys Arryn, killed during Robert's Rebellion.
*** Alys's grandson by her daughter, Harrold Hardyng.
* Lord Jon's youngest and deceased brother, Ser Ronnel Arryn.
** Ser Ronnel's son, Ser Elbert Arryn, formerly Lord Jon's heir, slain at the order of the Mad King before the rebellion.
