The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are divided between many hundreds of noble houses of various sizes. In Westeros ultimate power derives from the King on the Iron Throne and descends through the Great Houses that rule the constituent regions of the continent to their vassals.

There are nine Great Houses, and each of them have a number of vassal houses (sometimes also referred to as lesser houses) in their liege. The most powerful vassal houses may themselves field armies of a few thousand and control large regions, while the smallest houses may be little more than impoverished landholders with only a few men to their name. Members of the nobility are called highborn, in contrast to lowborn commoners.

Some of the most powerful noble Houses rival the smaller Great Houses in terms of wealth and the size of the armies they can field, e.g. House Hightower rules Oldtown, the second largest city in Westeros, and possesses large armies and fleets of its own. Other noble Houses, while technically holding this rank, are relatively poor.  

A typical noble house is seated at a castle and controls the land around it, collecting tithes and taxes from farmers, lesser landholders and smallfolk. In times of war they are expected to recruit and maintain a number of soldiers for their lieges. In most of Westeros only men can become ruling lords, and women can only rule if the rest of the male line has been extinguished or if they are acting as regents for their sons until they become of majority.

In Dorne men and women have equal property, inheritance and ruling rights.

In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels and accompanying short stories, websites and RPG sourcebooks, there are over 300 named noble houses of Westeros. All of these are sworn to the Great Houses.

However, George R.R. Martin has admitted that his system of nomenclature for noble Houses isn't very precise, as major and minor lords are both called simply lords (as opposed to differentiating between duke and baron etc.) Each of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms has about a dozen or so major Houses, i.e. House Umber is sworn to House Stark, rules a large area of the North, and several minor Houses serve the Umbers. House Cassel, meanwhile, is a minor House, sworn directly to House Stark, which has no minor Houses serving it. Thus there are roughly about 100 or so major Houses in the Seven Kingdoms at any one time, and numerous minor Houses who in turn serve them (not all of whom have been named).

Some of the noble Houses have a marked propensity for physical traits which are passed down through the generations. They do not have a concept of genetics as such, but sometimes understand that the seed is strong and that black hair tends to be a dominant trait over blonde hair. Some of the notable examples include:

*House Baratheon - black hair, blue eyes, and square jaws
*House Bolton - Black hair and eerie ghost grey eyes (somewhere between very pale blue and practically like dirty ice)
*House Florent - large ears
*House Lannister - curly blonde hair and green eyes
**House Lannister of Lannisport - straight blonde hair and green eyes
*House Martell - classic Salty Dornish features of olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes.
*House Redwyne - red hair
*House Stark - Black hair and grey eyes
*House Umber - very large size, frequently over six feet tall and well-built
*House Targaryen - classic Valyrian features of pale skin, white (platinum-blonde) hair, and purple eyes (changed to simply brightly colored, i.e. blue eyes in the TV series)
*House Tully - auburn hair and blue eyes
It hasn't been said that there is a traditional House Greyjoy look, but most in the current generation tend to have dark hair. So few living members of House Arryn have appeared in the narrative that it isn't clear what a typical Arryn looks like. Sweetrobin is half-Tully and thus might not be a good indication. Both Sweetrobin and his cousin Harold have blue eyes, as well as brown hair; though they are said to be among the purest Andal bloodlines, and Andals often have lighter hair.
