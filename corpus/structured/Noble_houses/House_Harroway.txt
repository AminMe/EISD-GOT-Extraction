House Harroway is an extinct noble house of the Riverlands. Their sigil was per bend sinister orange and black rayonne, a castle countercharged. 

Their seat was the castle of Harrenhal, which was granted to them after the extinction of House Towers. However, the Harroways also died out, and the castle was passed on to House Strong. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Harroway's backstory is the same. There is a town, called Lord Harroway's Town, that is named after a former lord of the house. 

King Maegor the Cruel, who kept a harem of wives, was married to Alys Harroway. See also (spoilers from the books)
