House Mudd is an extinct great house that once ruled the Riverlands as Kings of the Rivers and Hills. Eventually, however, their line was seemingly extinguished after being defeated by the Storm Kings of House Durrandon. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Mudd was the last dynasty of First Men that ruled the Riverlands. Their seat was a castle now in ruins and called Oldstones. Under King Tristifer IV, the Hammer of Justice, they resisted the Andal Invasion. Tristifer IV was said to have been victorious in ninety nine battles, but was defeated at his hundreth, in which seven Kings banded against him. Under his successor, King Tristifer V, House Mudd fell to the Andals. 

​Tr​istan Mudd was a Lord Commander of theNight'sWatch and is remembered as one of the worst Lord Commanders the Night's Watch has ever had. 

In Essos there are still Westerosi exiles with the surname Mudd, but it is unknown if these are true descendants of House Mudd. See also (spoilers from the books) References
