In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the crannogmen of the Neck are gifted and talented hunters and warriors. They have an ages-old feud with House Frey, who rule the lands immediately to the south. The Reeds came to the attention of their liege lords, House Stark, when Howland Reed met Eddard Stark at a tournament at Harrenhal. Howland Reed and Eddard Stark became fast friends and allies. Aside from Eddard, Howland was the only survivor of the raid at the Tower of Joy, on the occasion of Lyanna Stark's death. The Reed stronghold at Greywater Watch is hard to find because it supposedly moves around on a floating island.
