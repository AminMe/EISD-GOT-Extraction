In the books
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the House of Pahl is one of the ancient slaving families of Meereen, known as the Great Masters. They own a pyramid made of pink and white bricks, the family's colors.
Oznak is not the only man of his house who gets killed at Daenerys's orders: his father dies defending the city gatesduring the siege, and his three uncles are among the one hundred and sixty three slavers Daenerys orders to be executed. As a result, while many of the Meereenese noble houses are hostile toward Daenerys, the house of Pahl hates her most of all.
