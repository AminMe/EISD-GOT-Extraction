In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, members of House Dayne are Stony Dornishmen, whose characteristics mostly resemble the rest of the Seven Kingdoms in look, customs and traditions (being composed of the same First Men/Andal mixture). Unlike the rest of the more Rhoynish-looking Dornishmen, however, they have pale skin with hair ranging from dark brown to pale blond and they often have violet eyes, though according to George R.R. Martin they are not of Valyrian descent.

Died at the Tower of Joy. Ashara Dayne, his aunt. The manner of her death remains a mystery. Allyria Dayne, his aunt. Ser Gerold Dayne aka Darkstar, from a lesser branch of the family seated at High Hermitage. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books)
