Their heraldry consists of nine black bats over a gold field. Their motto is not known. Their heraldry is apparently derived from the previous holders of Harrenhal, as House Lothston's heraldry was a single black bat over a field diagonally divided between gold and silver. Whether this indicates a family relationship, or simply references that they took House Lothston's old seat, is unclear.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Harrenhal is a castle of ill repute. Every house that has held it has fallen into ruin. House Lothston, who held Harrenhal before the Whents, disintegrated in madness and fell deeds over half a century before the events of the series. The Whents chose to ignore this when they took possession of the castle, and indeed seemed to prosper. 

However, since that time the family has fallen on harder times. Lady Shella Whent's husband and children have all died. As a result, Lady Shella is left as a lonely old woman with her household inhabiting a vast and crumbling ruin. 

Lady Shella Whent is stated to have died (but it is not confirmed) soon before lordship of the castle was granted to Petyr Baelish, at which point House Whent was considered extinct by the crown - though the current generation of Tullys seem to have a claim on the lands, this was apparently ignored because they were in rebellion against the Iron Throne. Due to the alleged curse of Harrenhal (this is the reason Baelish gives Sansa, but he may have other reason), Baelish doesn't physically settle at Harrenhal after being named its lord, and treats the title as purely nominal - ignoring the devastated Riverlands to focus on wooing Lysa Arryn in the Vale. Harrenhal is retaken by a Lannister army led by Gregor Clegane soon before the Red Wedding, when Roose Bolton retreated his remaining garrison back to The Twins. Following the Red Wedding, it remains in control of a Lannister garrison. Having been seized, liberated, and retaken so many times, practically all of the original Whent servants who inhabited the castle were put to the sword by this point, save for only one washer-girl, one blacksmith and one cook. Members Lord Whent, a previous lord of the house, who was rich and open-handed. Lady Shella Whent, his wife. Presumed dead. Their four sons. Their daughter. The reigning Queen of Love and Beauty at the start of the Tourney at Harrenhal in 281AC, called the fair maid. Sarya Whent, fifth wife of Lord Walder Frey. Deceased with no progeny. Wynafrei Whent, married to the ninth son of Lord Walder Frey, Danwell. She had no progeny, only many stillbirths and miscarriages. The only known surviving member of the house. References
