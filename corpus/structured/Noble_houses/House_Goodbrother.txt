In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Goodbrother is one of the most powerful houses from Great Wyk. Their keep of Hammerhorn is inland, in the Hardstone Hills, their wealth not coming from the sea but from their mines. Their blazon is a gold-banded black warhorn on red. Their current lord is Gorold Goodbrother. 

House Goodbrother also has three cadet branches: House Goodbrother of Downdelving, House Goodbrother of Crow Spike Keep, and House Goodbrother of Corpse Lake. 

House Goodbrother briefly ruled the Iron Islands as Iron Kings. After a King of House Greyiron died, his brother called a kingsmoot while the King's son, Torgon, was away. However, Urragon Goodbrother was chosen instead. Urragon then killed all of the late King's family, becoming known as Badbrother. 

However, Torgon returned after two years and declared the kingsmoot unlawful since he wasnt' present to put forth his candidacy, as was his right. Due to Urragon's cruelty, the ironborn and the Drowned Men rose against Urragon and raised Torgon to kingship. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
