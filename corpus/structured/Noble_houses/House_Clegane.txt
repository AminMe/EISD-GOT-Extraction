House Clegane is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Lannister of Casterly Rock. Their lands are southeast of Casterly Rock and consist of a small patch of land and a modest house. They are landed knights rather than a full noble house, but have strong ties to the Lannisters. 

The current head of the family is Ser Gregor Clegane, known as The Mountain That Rides. Gregor has a younger brother, Sandor Clegane, known as The Hound. 

The Clegane sigil is three black dogs on a dark yellow background. The three dogs signify the three dogs that died fighting off the lioness that attacked Tytos Lannister.Complete Guide to Westeros - House Clegane\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-111249826656cca94fee8d7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / History 

 Background 

The founder of House Clegane was the grandfather of Gregor and Sandor, who served as the kennelmaster at Casterly Rock. While accompanying Lord Tytos Lannister on an excursion, they were attacked by a lioness. He rescued his master, losing three dogs and a leg in the process, and was awarded lands and title for his actions.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/locations\/cleganes-keep\/ HBO viewer's guide, season 2 map, Clegane's Keep entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-111249826656cca94fee8d7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Season 1

 Household and sworn men Joss Stilwood, squire to Ser Gregor. The Tickler, a torturer and interrogator stationed at Harrenhal. Killed by Jaqen H'ghar. Weasel, a gaoler at Harrenhal. In the books 

In A Song of Ice and Fire, the kennelmaster lost three hounds and a leg in the process of saving Lord Tytos. As a reward, Lord Tytos gave him lands and a towerhouse and took his son as his squire. Their sigil is three dogs on a yellow field; the three dogs represent the dogs that died saving Lord Tytos. Thoros commented that in view of the atrocities performed by the Cleganes, an image of two bloody infants would have been more suitable for their house sigil. 

Clegane's grandson, Gregor, became notable for his extreme size, and the rumor that he burned his younger brother's face as a child for playing with a toy without asking him. During Robert's Rebellion, Gregor Clegane proved his worth and ferocity in battle for Lord Tywin Lannister, who took note of him and made him one of his inner council of battle leaders, noting that he was the most feared man in the realm. 

Gregor's father, his younger sister, and his first two wives all died under unusual circumstances, leaving him and Sandor as the last members of the house. 

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, Clegane is pronounced Cli-GAIN, as opposed to CLEG-ain, etc. Image Gallery
