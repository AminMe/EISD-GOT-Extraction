 House Redwyne is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Tyrell of Highgarden. Their lands are located on the island of The Arbor, southwest of Highgarden. Its heraldry consists of a burgundy grape cluster on a white field. History 

 Background 

The Arbor is known for producing the finest wines in the Seven Kingdoms. Due to their island location, their merchant ships require great protection at sea, so the Redwyne Fleet is one of the three largest in the realm. The Redwynes enjoy a particularly close relationship with its overlord, House Tyrell.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season-1\/episode-5\/map\/location\/50\/the-arbor HBO viewers guide, season 1: episode 5 map, The Arbor entry\/ref data-rte-instance130814-101652074156cca959d589a classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext /

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Redwyne is a one of the most powerful noble families in the Reach. A large portion of the wines exported across Westeros come from the Arbor, and the higher-quality wines produced on the Arbor are considered to be the best in Westeros. Due to their island location and heavy involvement in the wine trade, House Redwyne maintains a large fleet of ships. The Redwyne fleet forms a significant portion of the fleet of the Reach, of which Lord Paxter Redwyne serves as high admiral and commander. 

Members of House Redwyne tend to have bright orange hair. 

While most vassal Houses from the Reach joined House Tyrell in fighting for the royal House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion, the Redwynes are noted for being particularly staunch Targaryen-loyalists. 

The Season 2 Blu-ray special features display the Redwyne sigil under a list of Renly Baratheon's supporters, but in the books House Redwyne does not declare for Renly. They wanted to, but during the early stages of the War of the Five Kings Queen Cersei Lannister holds the twin sons of Lord Paxter hostage at the royal court. After Renly dies, they join their Tyrell liege lords in aiding the Lannister army in the Battle of the Blackwater. 

A slight difference is that the sigil of House Redwyne in the books is a burgundy grape cluster on a blue field, but the TV series changed this to a burgundy grape cluster on a white field.
