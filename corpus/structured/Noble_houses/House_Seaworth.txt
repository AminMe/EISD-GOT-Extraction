Their lands are located on Cape Wrath in the Stormlands. Their home is a small but cozy keep near the sea. 

House Seaworth is ruled by the landed knight Ser Davos Seaworth, the so-called Onion Knight, a reformed smuggler in the service of Lord Stannis Baratheon at Dragonstone. His wife Marya and their youngest sons are usually found at their keep. 

House Seaworth came into existence after Robert's Rebellion. Davos Seaworth, a smuggler infamous on the Narrow Sea for being able to smuggle anything anywhere, transported a cargo hold full of onions into the besieged castle of Storm's End, keeping the garrison alive until the war was over. Stannis Baratheon rewarded Davos by knighting him and giving him lands, though he also insisted on taking the tips of the fingers on Davos' right hand in compensation for his smuggling. Davos judged this fair, since it bought him and his family a more secure future, one he could never have imagined, much less earned for them on his own.http:\/\/viewers-guide.hbo.com\/game-of-thrones\/season2\/#!\/guide\/houses\/sbaratheon\/davos-seaworth\/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of Dragonstone, Davos Seaworth entry\/ref} data-rte-instance130814-75081733556cca96b9fee8 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Members Ser Davos Seaworth, called the Onion Knight, a landed knight, advisor to King Stannis Baratheon and a former smuggler.

 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Davos Seaworth has seven sons: Dale, Allard, Matthos, Marc, Devan, Stannis, and Steffon. The oldest five serve in Stannis' army, though the younger two are children too young to serve. Dale, Allard, Matthos, and Marc are all killed in the Battle of the Blackwater. In the TV series, these four sons have been functionally condensed into Matthos. Till now only Matthos appeared and was mentioned after his death, suggesting that he was Davos' only son.
