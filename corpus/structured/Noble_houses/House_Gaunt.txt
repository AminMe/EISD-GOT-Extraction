House Gaunt is a vassal house from the Crownlands. It holds fealty to House Baratheon of King's Landing. Members Ser Gwayne Gaunt, a knight of the Kingsguard during the reign of Aerys II Targaryen. Killed by Ser Symon Hollard during the Defiance of Duskendale. Ser Barristan Selmy avenged his death. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, little is mentioned about House Gaunt other than their sigil and Ser Gwayne's death. 

Incidentally, George R.R. Martin has said that the narrative of the novel series is loosely inspired by the real-life War of the Roses, a succession war in England during the late fifteenth century. Much of the war centered around who was the rightful heir to King Edward III: John of Gaunt was Edward III's third son, and his descendants were the House of Lancaster (which produced kings Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI). John of Gaunt was so-called because he was born in the city of Ghent in Flanders, and at the time Ghent was rendered into English spelling as Gaunt. See also
