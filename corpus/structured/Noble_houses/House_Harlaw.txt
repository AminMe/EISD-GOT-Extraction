In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Harlaw is a powerful family with strong ties to the Greyjoys. They have several branches along the island of Harlaw as well as several vassals. The sigil of House Harlaw is a silver scythe on black. The current head of the family is Lord Rodrik Harlaw, brother of Lady Alannys Harlaw, called Rodrik the Reader for his passion for books (a habit that other ironmen find strange and unmanly).
