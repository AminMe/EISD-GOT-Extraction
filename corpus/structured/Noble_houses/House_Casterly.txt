 In the books 

In A Song of Ice and Fire, the background of House Casterly is the same. Their sigil, motto and ultimate fate remains unknown, though they clearly no longer existed by the time of the War of Conquest. That is, even within the narrative, there are rival myths about exactly what happened to the Casterlys. Some say that Lann tricked them into killing each other, then may have finished off the survivors. Others say that Lann infested their castle with rats, or even lions, to drive them out. The more pragmatic story is that Lann was simply a man-at-arms in their castle who impregnated the current Lord Casterly's daughter, and with no other heirs this left Lann as the new Lord of Casterly Rock through his child. There is also the possibility that he impregnated and married a minor member of the family, then used his wits to manipulate his way into a position of greater power. 

The Casterlys were very rich, but did not call themselves kings, nor did Lann the Clever call himself king. The Lannisters only started calling themselves kings many generations later, after their steady accumulation of wealth made them very powerful. See also References
