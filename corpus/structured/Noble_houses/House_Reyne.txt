 House Reyne is an extinct vassal house of the Westerlands, formerly sworn to House Lannister of Casterly Rock. Their seat was Castamere. History 

 Background 

 For a time, House Reyne was the second wealthiest family in Westeros, behind House Lannister. They were not content with being the second wealthiest, however, and the last Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock, and gave his wife diamonds to wear which were bigger than any that Tywin Lannister'swife Joanna ever wore.\Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-29625969956cca950b53b7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

Eventually, House Reyne openly challenged their liege-lords, feeling that House Lannister's rule over the Westerlands had grown weak under Tywin's ineffectual father Tytos Lannister. In response, however, the capable young Tywin Lannister marched his forces against the upstart Lord Reyne. At the end of the Reyne Rebellion, Tywin's army put Castamere castle to the torch, and had all surviving members of House Reyne put to the sword - man, woman, and child - as an example to any vassals who would dare challenge the Lannisters in the future. Tywin subsequently had the corpses of the executed Reynes hung from the gates of Casterly Rock on public display, where he left them to rot for the entire summer (it was a long summer, which lasted many years).\House Lannister (Complete Guide to Westeros)\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-29625969956cca950b53b7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /\The Westerlands (Histories &amp; Lore)\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-29625969956cca950b53b7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw typeext /\Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons\\/ref data-rte-instance130814-29625969956cca950b53b7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / 

The destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song The Rains of Castamere. data-rte-instance130814-29625969956cca950b53b7 classplaceholder placeholder-ext srcdata:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw type=ext / Season 3

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Reynes were one of the richest and most powerful families in the Westerlands after the Lannisters. During their defiance against Casterly Rock and Lord Tytos Lannister, the Reynes rose alongside the ancient House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall. Both houses were totally annihilated by Tywin Lannister.
