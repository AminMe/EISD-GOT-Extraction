During rewrites, Robb Stark's romantic interest beganto get anincreasinglydifferent backstory than in the novels. George R.R. Martin himself suggested the name Maegyr as an old Volantene name to accommodate the changes from his source novels.Ryan, Maureen (September 4, 2012). http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/09\/04\/game-of-thrones-season-3-characters_n_1854918.html 'Game of Thrones' Season 3 Characters And Scoop From Creator George R.R.

In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Malaquo Maegyr is one of the Triarchs of Volantis, the city's three rulers. Triarchs like Malaquo Maegyr are elected from amongst those noble families who can prove unbroken descent from old Valyria. Malaquo Maegyr is a Tiger, from the Old Bloods political faction who favor more resource allocation into preparing for war. Fittingly, the sigil next to the onscreen credit for Oona Chaplinin the opening titles, who portrays Talisa Maegyr, is two tigers circling one another. Nevertheless, Volantene families do not employ sigils, which is a Westerosi custom. References
