 In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the house Cerwyn is one of closest bannermen to the Starks, Castle Cerwyn being just a half day's ride from Winterfell. 

Following the deaths of Lord Medger Cerwyn and his son Cley, Lady Jonelle, past thirty, swears fealty to the newWarden of the North, LordRoose Bolton. Cerwyn men are present at Winterfell for the wedding of Ramsay Bolton. Members Lord Medger Cerwyn, Lord of Cerwyn. Taken captive by the Lannisters at the Battle of the Green Fork, and later died of his injuries at Harrenhal. Lady Jonella Cerwyn, his daughter. A homely maid, past thirty. Lord Cley Cerwyn, his son. Killed by the Boltons during the Sack of Winterfell. 

The Cerwyn heraldry is slightly different in the TV series. In the novels, it is a black battle-axe on a white background. In the TV series, it is a silver-bladed battle-axe with a black shaft, on a grey background. 

Cerwyn bannerman Ser Kyle Condon was in command of one of the only Northern armies that may have survived after the Red Wedding - not counting the Stark-loyal River Lord houses such as the Tullys. When Roose Bolton marched the eastern half of the Stark army back to the Twins, he intentionally advanced slow enough to allow Gregor Clegane to fall on his rear guard in the Battle of Ruby Ford - intentionally sending Stark loyalists on suicide missions while leaving his own Bolton forces unblooded and intact. After crossing the Trident, his remaining army consisted of around 3,500 Bolton men, and 600 men from other Northern Houses. Not wanting these remaining Stark-loyal men to interfere in the betrayal at the Twins, he left them to command the northern bank of the Trident, under the command of Ser Kyle Condon and Ronnel Stout (the Stouts being bannermen of House Dustin). Oddly, afterwards no mention at all was made of what happened to Kyle Condon and his small army detachment, even though they were not present at the Red Wedding.
