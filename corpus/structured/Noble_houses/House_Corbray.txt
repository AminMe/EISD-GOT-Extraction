In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Corbrays are an old but poor house. They hold the Valyrian steel blade known as Lady Forlorn. 

The heraldry of House Corbray in the books is three black ravens in flight, each holding a separate red heart, on a white field. In the TV series continuity (as briefly glimpsed in an animated featurette), it is a single black raven rather than three. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
