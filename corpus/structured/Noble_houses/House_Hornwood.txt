In A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Hornwood is a loyal vassal of the Starks. House Bolton is said to have designs on their fertile lands. 

When Robb Stark summoned his bannermen, Lord Halys Hornwood and his son Daryn went to Winterfell and joined his army. Daryn became one of Robb's personal guards. Both of them were killed in the subsequent battles. 

Once Ramsay Snow learned about the death of Halys and Daryn, he kidnapped Lady Donella, raped her, and forced her to marry him and to sign a will naming him the sole heir of the Hornwood lands. Then he locked her in a cell and did not bring her food. When Ser Rodrik Cassel arrived to save her, it was too late: she starved to death after chewing several of her fingers.
