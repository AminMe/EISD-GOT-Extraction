</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Strictly speaking, a "cadet branch" consists of only male-line descendants, in an unbroken chain from father to son - in which case the founding member was a younger son of another noble House. The inheritance systems in the Seven Kingdoms do not put as much value on descent through the female line. New Houses have been formed from the female-line younger descendants of other Houses, but their lineage is considered inferior compared to other cadet branches who can claim male-line descent. For example, <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"House Tyrell","link":"House Tyrell","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[House Tyrell]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-4706095956cca95dbfdd2" href="/wiki/House_Tyrell" title="House Tyrell">House Tyrell</a>  descents from the Gardeners, but only through a Gardener daughter - which means that other houses of the Reach descend from a Gardener son have a superior line of descent compared to the Tyrells.

While the two noble families in conflict during the War of the Five Kings are the Starks and Lannisters, the two noble families in conflict during the War of the RosesÂ were the Yorks and Lancasters.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Both the House of York and the House of Lancaster were cadet branches of the previous royal family, the House of Plantagenet. All claimed descent from King Edward III, who had five sons who survived to adulthood, and a daughter (who despite being eldest was considered behind the sons due to male-preference inheritance). Edward III's eldest son was Edward the Black Prince, who predeceased his father, and thus the Black Prince's own son succeeded Edward III as King Richard II.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Edward III's younger four sons were Lionel of Antwerp, John of Gaunt, Edward of Langley, and Thomas of Woodstock. The descendants of John of Gaunt (Ghent) founded the cadet branch of Lancaster, while Edward of Langley's descendants formed the cadet branch of York.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">John of Gaunt's son, Henry IV of Bolingbroke, overthrew Richard II in a rebellion. This ended the line of eldest son Edward the Black Prince, and the Plantagenet dynasty itself, while Henry IV ruled as the first king from House Lancaster. The Lancasters were the eldest surviving branch with direct male-to-male descent, despite the fact that John of Gaunt was not Edward III's second son, but his third. Edward III's second son was Lionel of Antwerp, but his only surviving child was a daughter, Philippa, and thus his descendants did not have direct male-line descent. Philippa married into the powerful Mortimer family. The Yorks, meanwhile, were descended from the fourth son, and could not claim better descent than the Lancasters. Henry IV's son Henry V ruled after him, famed for his role in the Battle of Agincourt. After Henry V's death, however, his son Henry VI was only an infant, and power in England become dominated by a regency council.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Eventually, the head of the House of York married Philippa's granddaughter Anne Mortimer, uniting the branches of the second and fourth sons of Edward III. Through Anne Mortimer and ultimately Philippa, the Yorks could claim a more senior line of descent than the Lancasters (descended from the third son), but only according to gender-blind equal primogeniture, when male-preference primogeniture was the law. The Yorks pressed this claim anyway and ultimately usurped the throne from the Lancasters during the War of the Roses, beginning with Anne's grandson King Edward IV. The House of Lancaster was driven to extinction with the death of Henry VI, as his son and only child Edward predeceased him at the Battle of Tewkesbury.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Edward IV was succeeded by the next Yorkist king, his brother Richard III - despite the fact that Edward IV had two underaged sons, Edward and Richard, who were infamously locked away in the Tower of London and "disappeared", after which it was strongly suspected that Richard III had them killed (later historians consider the elder prince to have technically been the legal monarch for the three month period between his father's death and his disappearance, and thus he is officially counted as King Edward V).
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">While the Yorks had destroyed the "House of Lancaster", they had not destroyed all of John of Gaunt's descendants. Henry IV was John's only legitimate son, but he had several <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"bastard","link":"Bastardy","wasblank":false,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Bastardy|bastard]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-4706095956cca95dbfdd2" href="/wiki/Bastardy" title="Bastardy">bastard</a> sons with his mistress Katherine Swynford. John later married Katherine as his third wife, and had his four children by her (including three sons) legitimized, though with the agreement that they would be excluded from the royal line of succession. These legitimized children formed a new cadet branch, the "House of Beaufort". John of Gaunt's eldest son (also named John) himself had a son (also named John). The younger two bastard sons died without issue. John of Gaunt's grandson John had one child, Margaret Beaufort, who married into the House of Tudor (a noble family from Wales). At the age of thirteen, and two months after her husband's death, Margaret gave birth to the future Henry VII.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Henry Tudor grew up in exile in France, but over time Richard III gained enemies in England (including old Lancaster supporters), who began to rally around the exiled Henry Tudor as an alternative. Henry eventually led an invasion into England, and in 1485 his army clashed with Richard III and his own army at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard III died in the battle, and Henry VII became the first king of the Tudor dynasty. Henry VII then married Elizabeth of York, daughter and only surviving child of Edward IV, to unite the two cadet branches of York and Lancaster as the new Tudor dynasty.
</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true" data-rte-empty-lines-before="1">Similarly, in the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> narrative, there is considerable fighting between cadet branches over what constitutes the legitimate line of succession, while a key male figure (John of Gaunt versus Robert Baratheon) actually leaves behind bastard children (the Beauforts versus <a data-rte-meta="{"type":"internal","text":"Gendry","link":"Gendry","wasblank":true,"noforce":true,"wikitext":"[[Gendry]]"}" data-rte-instance="130814-4706095956cca95dbfdd2" href="/wiki/Gendry" title="Gendry">Gendry</a>) who by simple birth order would technically be higher in the line of succession.
