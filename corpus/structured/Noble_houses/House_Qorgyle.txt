In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Qorgyle - along with House Uller - are Sandy Dornishmen, from the harsh central desert of Dorne. Their home is an oasis amidst the sands. When the Rhoynar migrated to Dorne a thousand years ago, they settled primarily on the coasts and in the river valleys, and as a result this is where their impact upon Dorne's ethnic makeup was greatest. In contrast, the Rhoynar barely settled in the Red Mountains of western Dorne, where whose inhabitants are still mostly descended from the same First Men/Andal stock as the rest of southern Westeros. The Rhoynar ethnic makeup therefore forms a gradient from east to west in Dorne, forming three loose categories: the Salty Dornishmen of the coasts are mostly descended from the Rhoynar, while the Stony Dornishmen of the mountains who have little or no Rhoynar ancestry. The third major group are the Sandy Dornishmen of the central deserts, who possess an intermediate mix of Rhoynar and First Men/Andal ancestry. Ironically, despite having less Rhoynar blood the Sandy Dornishmen actually have darker skin than the Salty Dornishmen, because their ancestors were burned and bronzed by the desert sun for hundreds of years. 

Prince Oberyn Martell fostered as a Ward of House Qorgyle at Sandstone when he was a child. As a result, the Qorgyles are considered staunch allies of the Martells in the current generation. 

A member of House Qorgyle was Jeor Mormont's immediate predecessor as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, though he has died by the time the novels begin. 

The members of House Qorgyle at the time of the novels are: Lord Quentyn Qorgyle, Lord of Sandstone. Ser Gulian Qorgyle, his eldest son and heir to Sandstone. Ser Arron Qorgyle, his second son. See also (MAJOR spoilers from the books) References
