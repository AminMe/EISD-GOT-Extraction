Staff writer Bryan Cogman came up with the idea of the stillborn fetuses being preserved in jars. Cogman said in an interview, "It was a proud day for me as a writer when I walked on set and saw those magnificently nasty prop dead babies floating in those jars." In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire book series, there is no mention Selyse Baratheon having any stillborn sons. 

He shares a name with King Robert's one acknowledged bastard from the novels: Edric Storm. For the TV series, Edric Storm's storyline in the third novel is merged with Gendry's. 

To be clear: Selyse's stillborn son "Edric Baratheon" is not the TV series's "version" of Edric Storm. Selyse isn't stated to have any stillborn sons in the novels, thus the writers had to make up names for all three - and they tried to remain internally consistent by choosing other common names used for characters from the Stormlands in the books.
