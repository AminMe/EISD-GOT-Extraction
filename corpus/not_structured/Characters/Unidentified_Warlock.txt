In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daenerys is the target of an assassination attempt before abandoning Qarth, and is saved by Barristan Selmy, though he is under the assumed identity of "Arstan Whitebeard" at the time. In the books, this occurred on the docks of Qarth as she was leaving, but the TV series moved it forward slightly to occur in Astapor, soon after Dany arrives from Qarth. In the books, the would-be assassin is not a Warlock but a Sorrowful Man, an ancient guild of assassins in Qarth known for whispering "I am so sorry" to their victims before killing them. It is not known who orders the attempt on Dany's life, as several Qartheen factions have called for her death by this time in the narrative, though the Warlocks have a special interest in Daenerys' death after her dragons kill their leaders, the Undying Ones, when she tries to leave from the House of the Undying.
