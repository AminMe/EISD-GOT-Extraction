Bessie Season(s) 1 Mentioned in "The Kingsroad" Robert Baratheon: "There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca. With the great big tits you could bury your face in." Eddard Stark: "Bessie. She was one of yours." Robert Baratheon: "Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie. And her tits." — Robert Baratheon reminiscing.[src] 

Bessie was a common girl that Robert Baratheon enjoyed having sex with during Robert's Rebellion. 

While reminiscing with Ned Stark, Robert is trying to recall the name of Ned's mistress, confusing Bessie with Wylla.&nbsp;Robert remembers her fondly as having big breasts. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the conversation is very similar except&nbsp;Ned does not correct Robert on her name not being Becca, and Robert fondly remembers her sweet big eyes rather than her big breasts.
