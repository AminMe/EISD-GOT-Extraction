Daario Naharis and Grey Worm find him hiding in a house in Meereen and arrest him. Daenerys Targaryen consults her advisors and Mossador urges her to kill him to send a message to the Sons of the Harpy. Ser Barristan Selmy advises her to exercise caution and give him a fair trial as a way of maintaining the equality among the citizens, to which she agrees.

Mossador dumps his corpse in public, his face covered by his harpy mask and writes "kill the masters" on a wall in his blood. He is executed as punishment for this.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no parallel to this character. The Brazen Beasts (an army of watchmen formed by&nbsp;Daenerys) have taken dozens of the Harpy’s Sons, and those who have survived their capture have yielded names when questioned sharply, but the identity of their leader remains unknown.
