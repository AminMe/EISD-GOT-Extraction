Mighdal Season(s) 4 Mentioned in "The Children" Status Alive Origin Meereen Allegiance Great Masters Culture Ghiscari Family Calla - daughter "Before you freed me I belonged to Master Mighdal." ―Fennesz to Daenerys Targaryen[src]Master Mighdal&nbsp;is one of the former&nbsp;Great Masters of the Free City of Meereen. 

He owned a slave named Fennesz, who was tasked with educating the children of the household. After Daenerys Targaryen took the city and freed all the slaves, Fennesz asked her to be allowed to re-sell himself into slavery, as Mighdal and his family had treated him well. The queen allowed for Fennesz and Mighdal to sign a contract of employment, but only for a period of one year at a time. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no character named Mighdal. His name was chosen by D.B. Weiss in honor of his beloved childhood friend David Migdal. 

The characters of Mighdal and Fennesz were invented to present a problem alluded to in the books, the plight of slaves whose lives actually worsened with freedom. References Edit ↑ "The Children" Retrieved from "http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Mighdal?oldid=193642"
