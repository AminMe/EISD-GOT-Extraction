In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Talla has been briefly mentioned as Sam's sister but otherwise not described in detail and has not yet appeared. 

Randyll Tarly has five children: his eldest child Samwell, then three daughters, and finally his second son Dickon Tarly. After he became dissatisfied with the bookish Samwell as a child he kept having more children with his wife until they produced another son to replace him. Talla is the eldest of Samwell's three sisters (the other two haven't been named).
