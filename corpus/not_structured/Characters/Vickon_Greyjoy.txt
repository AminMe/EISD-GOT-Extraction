Vickon Greyjoy is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is deceased when the events of the series begin. 

Lord Vickon was the head of House Greyjoy and the Lord Reaper of Pyke during the reign of King Harren the Black of House Hoare. After Harren and his line were burned alive by Aegon the Conqueror&nbsp;and his&nbsp;dragon inside his castle of Harrenhal&nbsp;during the&nbsp;War of Conquest, the ironborn were expelled from the Riverlands back to the Iron Islands. In exchange for their allegiance, Aegon allowed the&nbsp;ironborn to choose their new leader. They chose Vickon Greyjoy: his House was one of the most prominent in the Isles, claiming descent from the legendary Grey King. In the books Edit
