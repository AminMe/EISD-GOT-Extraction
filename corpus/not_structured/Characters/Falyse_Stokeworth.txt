Lollys Stokeworth - sister 

Falyse Stokeworth is an unseen minor character on Game of Thrones. She is the eldest daughter of House Stokeworth and heir to Castle Stokeworth. 

"Falyse" is pronounced "Fahl-lease". Contents[show] BiographyEdit Season 4Edit 

Falyse crops up in a conversation between Tyrion Lannister and Bronn, when the latter visits Tyrion in his cell while awaiting his trial. Bronn reveals that Cersei Lannister has arranged a marriage between him and Falyse's younger sister Lollys in a successful effort to sway the ambitious ex-sellsword&nbsp;from Tyrion's&nbsp;service. Tyrion&nbsp;points out that Falyse, not Lollys, is&nbsp;the heir to&nbsp;House Stokeworth&nbsp;and their castle.&nbsp;Bronn has apparently already considered this, and remarks that Falyse&nbsp;is&nbsp;barren and should she perish before her father,&nbsp;Lollys&nbsp;would become the heir. Season 5Edit 

Lollys Stokeworth and her newly betrothed Ser Bronn of the Blackwater walk on the grounds outside the castle, as Lollys talks excitedly about plans for their upcoming wedding. Bronn muses that he never thought he'd end up settling down in a fine a place as this. Confused, Lollys corrects him that after her mother (Tanda Stokeworth) dies, the castle will pass to her sister, because she is older than Lollys. She also says that her sister hates her, calls her names, and even still she pulls Lollys's hair when she thinks their mother isn't looking. Bronn assures Lollys that her sister is mean, and mean people always end up getting what's coming to them - clearly still holding to his plan to surreptitiously kill off Falyse after he marries Lollys. 

They then see that Jaime Lannister has arrived at the castle. He privately informs Bronn that he needs him to accompany a secret mission he is taking to Dorne. To encourage Bronn to go, the Lannisters have now promised Lollys to Wyllis Bracken: Jaime vaguely promises that they will find Bronn a better bride with an even bigger castle, though Bronn is not amused.
