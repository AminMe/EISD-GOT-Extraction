Arya and the Hound meet the farmer on the kingsroad. The cart is not broken, and the farmer does not need help to fix it. The Hound forces the farmer at swordpoint to give his cart, horses, casks and most of his clothes, but does not intend to kill him. Arya does not intervene. The farmer reluctantly complies, and curses the Hound for a robber. The Hound answers "No, a forager. Be grateful you get to keep your smallclothes. Now take those boots off. Or I'll take your legs off. Your choice". The farmer is as big as the Hound, but wisely chooses to give up his boots and keep his legs. Then Arya and the Hound continue their journey to the Twins, leaving the farmer behind. 

Neither the Hound nor Arya knocks the farmer unconscious or otherwise physically harms him. ReferencesEdit â†‘ "The Rains of Castamere" Retrieved from "http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hog_farmer?oldid=210238"
