Elia Sand is an unseen character in the fourth season. She is first mentioned in "First of His Name". Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Elia Sand is the fifth of the eight bastard daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, known as the "Sand Snakes". Her mother is Oberyn's paramour, Ellaria Sand. She was named after her aunt, the late Princess Elia Martell. Season 4Edit 

Oberyn writes a poem to Elia and mentions her willful behavior to Queen Cersei Lannister. He explains that he named her after his murdered sister, but this ended up making him sad when he talks to her, which in turn leads to him being angry around her. Cersei, in a rare moment of genuine motherly insight, suggests that this may be the cause of her behavior.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Elia Sand is described as wearing her black hair in a braid and having her father's eyes. She's fond of horses and jousting, for which she often smells like a horse to her mother's despair. Her weapon of choice is the lance, for which she's dubbed "Lady Lance". Her mother affectionately refers to her as "El".
