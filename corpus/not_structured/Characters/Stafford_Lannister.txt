In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Stafford Lannister is the brother of Joanna Lannister. He and his sister were the children of Lord Tytos Lannister's younger brother. Thus, both Joanna and Stafford were first cousins of Tywin and the main branch of the family. 

In his youth, Stafford and two more Lannisters were captured by Lady Tarbeck in retaliation for the imprisonment of her lord husband by Tytos Lannister. She threatened to kill the captives if her husband would be harmed. Tywin suggested his father to send Lord Tarbeck back to his wife in three pieces, but the soft-hearted Tytos complied and returned Tarbeck unharmed in exchange for the three Lannisters. 

Stafford dies in the Battle of Oxcross, killed by Lord Rickard Karstark. Both Jaime Lannister and Brynden Tully consider him a poor commander as he didn't scout the area believing Robb Stark was far away. Robb Stark had been led by Grey Wind along a goat path and had thus bypasses fortified positions in order to attack undetected. 

The Lannister survivors regrouped at Lannisport under Ser Daven Lannister, Stafford's son and widely considered to be a more intelligent commander than his father.
