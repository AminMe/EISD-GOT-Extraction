Imry Florent is a minor character in the second season. He is played by guest star Gordon Mahn and only appears in "Blackwater." Ser Imry Florent is a member of House Florent and brother of Axell Florent and Queen Selyse, the wife of King Stannis I. Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Ser Imry Florent is a member of House Florent of Brightwater Keep, a noble house sworn to House Tyrell of the Reach. However, due to his sister Selyse's marriage to Stannis, the Florents declare for Stannis in the War of the Five Kings. Season 2Edit 

Ser Imry accompanies Stannis aboard the King's flagship, the Fury. After much of Stannis' fleet is destroyed with wildfire, Stannis orders his forces to disembark. Ser Imry warns Stannis that hundreds will die trying to reach the shore. The King replies that it will actually be thousands, but is the first to climb down to a ferry boat. 

As the King's flagship was not engulfed in wildfire during the battle, Ser Imry likely survived the ensuing conflict and retreated upon the defeat of Stannis' army.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ser Imry Florent, like the rest of House Florent, declares for Stannis after the death of Renly Baratheon. He's given command of Stannis' fleet as Lord High Captain and leads it blindly into Blackwater Rush&nbsp;instead of sending scouts like Ser Davos advised. He was killed in the battle when the flagship Fury is engulfed in wildfire.
