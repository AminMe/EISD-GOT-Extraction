Deceased In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Elaena was the third daughter of King Aegon III. She's described as being not as pretty as her sisters, but her beauty matured as she got older. Her eyes were soft lilac and her hair was platinum-white with a gold streak down the middle, which she wore long, pulled back and in a braid. She liked to dress in black, like her father. Elaena was eleven when she was confined along with her sisters and cut off her hair in protest, wearing it short for a while. 

She married three times, twice at a king's behest and once for passion, and gave birth to seven children. She then declared that if seven was sufficient for the Gods, it would do for her as well. Although she had three husbands during her lifetime, the great love of her life was her cousin, Lord Alyn Velaryon, the Oakenfist, with whom she had two bastard children, Jon and Jeyne Waters. Oakenfist was lost at sea while she was pregnant with their twins. She was then made to enter into her first marriage to old Lord Ossifer Plumm, who died on their wedding night. Elaena became pregnant around the same time and gave birth to Viserys Plumm - many suspected that he was really a bastard, but none openly challenged her claim that he was Ossifer's. She was then made to marry Lord Ronnel of House Penrose, by whom she had four trueborn children. Penrose was Master of Coin at the time for Elaena's cousin King Daeron II - though it is widely believed that Elaena was the true financial mastermind of the Iron Throne, Master of Coin in all but name, and her husband simply added his seal to letters she wrote. After he died she married again for love to Lord Manwoody, though they had no children. 

Elaena was known as being shrewd and intelligent, to the point that even though one of her husbands sat on the small council as Master of Coin, it was widely known that she was the one performing the duties.
