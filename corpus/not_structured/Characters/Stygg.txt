In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Stygg's background is the same. He is among the ironborn who raid the Stony Shore and part of the force that captures Winterfell. 

When the residents of Winterfell are gathered and told that they are captives of the ironborn, Stygg kills Mikken for speaking defiantly to Theon. Osha offers to serve Theon (falsely, while she stays loyal to the Starks), Stygg taunts her rudely, and in response she knees him in the groin and grabs his spear, to the amusement of Theon and the other ironborn. After the capture, Theon sent him to request aid from his sister Asha at Deepwood Motte. 

As Theon's position becomes hopeless, he tells the ironborn they can leave and join his sister's troops at Deepwood Motte or stay and fight with him against the Northmen who will arrive soon to retake Winterfell. Stygg is among those who abandon Theon, and he is the only of those who has the grace to look ashamed. 

Stygg is not mentioned in the books afterwards.
