Jhaqo is a recurring character in the sixth season, though he was already mentioned in the second season. He is a Dothraki Khal. Jhaqo is played by Joe Naufahu. Contents[show] BiographyEdit Season 2Edit 

After discovering the severed head of Rakharo inside a bag carried by Rakharo's horse, Ser Jorah Mormont considers either Khal Pono or Jhaqo as the culprits and that Rakharo was killed as a demonstration of contempt for the notion of a female leading a Khalasar. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Jhaqo is a ko in Khal Drogo's khalassar. After Drogo's fall from his horse and subsequent incapacitacion, Jhaqo is one of the several kos that declares himself Khal and takes a portion of the khalasar as his own. Among those who follow him is Mago&nbsp;(who is killed for challenging Drogo in the TV series, but in the book he is still alive for no such challenge&nbsp;occurs), who becomes Jhaqo's bloodrider. 

At the end of the fifth novel, Jhaqo and about fifty warriors of his khalasar encounter Daenerys while she is in the Dothraki sea after Drogon has flown her there. His reaction is not mentioned.
