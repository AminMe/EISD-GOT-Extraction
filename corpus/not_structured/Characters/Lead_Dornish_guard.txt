The Lead Dornish guard after being impaled in the throat by Bronn's knife. 

While riding along the Dornish coastline, the Dornish guard and his men discover Jaime Lannister and Bronn. Judging his accent, he assumes that Bronn is from King's Landing and asks them why they are so far from home. Bronn and Jaime try to convince the guard that their ship capsized in the night and they simply wish to return home. Suspicious of two armed travelers, the guard orders them to throw their swords in the sand. The two comply, but Bronn swiftly throws his knife at the lead guard which lands right in his throat, killing him. Appearances Edit Season Five appearances The Wars to Come The House of Black and White High Sparrow Sons of the Harpy Kill the Boy Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken The Gift Hardhome The Dance of Dragons Mother’s Mercy In the books Edit 

In the&nbsp;A Song of Ice and Fire&nbsp;novels there is no parallel character, nor parallel fight scene. Jaime and Bronn do not travel to Dorne at all. Instead, Cersei sends Ser&nbsp;Balon Swann, who goes to Dorne on an official mission to take Myrcella back, so he does not need to smuggle himself into the country, and does not have any similar violent encounter.
