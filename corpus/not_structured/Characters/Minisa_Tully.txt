In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lady Minisa Whent bore Hoster Tully two daughters (Catelyn and Lysa) and four sons, but of these only Edmure survived (Edmure was not her youngest son). Minisa died giving birth to her fourth and youngest son, who also perished, and afterwards Catelyn feels that some of the life has gone out of Lord Hoster as well. Catelyn recalls her mother was always calm as well as having a warm smile and soft hands. Catelyn wonders how their lives would have been different if her mother had not died.
