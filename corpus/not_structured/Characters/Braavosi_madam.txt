This Braavosi Madam is the proprietress, or at least a senior procuress, of a brothel in Braavos. Season 5Edit 

The Braavosi Madam is present when Ser Meryn Trant visits the brothel she works in, seeking for a prostitute. She presents three prostitutes to him, but he claims that they are all too old. Realizing with some distaste what Trant is seeking, she presents him with a very young serving girl. Trant informs the madam that he expects a "fresh" one tomorrow night, again to her distaste. Throughout the exchange, the Madam is vexed by the presence of Lanna, a young oyster-seller, so deep in the brothel, and warns her not to show up there again.
