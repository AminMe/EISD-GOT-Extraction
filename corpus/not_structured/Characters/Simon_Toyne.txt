Simon Toyne is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is not expected to appear in the series, being long dead by the time it starts. Simon Toyne was the leader of the Kingswood Brotherhood, an outlaw brotherhood. He was killed by Ser Barristan Selmy. Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Simon Toyne was the leader of the Kingswood Brotherhood, a band of outlaws and bandits opposed to the rule of House Targaryen. They inhabited the Kingswood, a large area of woodland south-east of King's Landing. Roughly twenty years before the events of the series, King Aerys II Targaryen ordered the Brotherhood destroyed, a mission led by Ser Barristan Selmy of the Kingsguard. Selmy himself killed Toyne with a counter-riposte, a move witnessed by the then-squire Jaime Lannister. Season 1Edit 

Jaime recalls Selmy killing Toyne and cites his counter-riposte as the finest sword move he'd ever seen. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Simon was a descendant of House Toyne. House Toyne was formerly a house of honor, with one member serving in the Kingsguard of King Aegon IV Targaryen. When Aegon IV found this knight abed with one of his mistresses, he had him executed in a horrible fashion. The knight's brothers declared war against House Targaryen, slaying the infamous Dragonknight, Ser Aemon Targaryen. Simon was their descendant and the last of his line.
