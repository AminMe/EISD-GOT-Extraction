Elboneno is a Meereenese noble and the head of one of the great families of the city. Season 5Edit 

He's arrested under orders of Queen Daenerys Targaryen along with several of his peers after a series of murders and attacks carried out by the Sons of the Harpy. He's taken to the catacombs beneath the Great Pyramid where Rhaegal and Viserion are kept chained and watches in horror as the two dragons burn and devour another Great Master.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there is no mention of a character named Elboneno. The name is "one noble" spelled backwards. The name doesn't fit the established naming conventions of the Ghiscari inhabitants of Slaver's Bay. 

In the books Daenerys never has the heads of the ancient slaving families arrested after the attacks of the Sons of the Harpy. Instead she has these families deliver a child as hostage. ReferencesEdit ↑ "Kill the Boy" Retrieved from "http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Elboneno?oldid=216544"
