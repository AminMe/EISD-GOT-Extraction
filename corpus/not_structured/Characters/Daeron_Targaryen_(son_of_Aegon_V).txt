Daeron Targaryen is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is long dead by the time the series begins. Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Daeron was the youngest son of King Aegon V Targaryen. He was betrothed to Olenna Redwyne, but she took a great dislike to his "twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair", and their engagement ended when Olenna seduced her sister Viola's intended husband Luthor Tyrell. Season 4Edit 

After Margaery Tyrell unexpectedly becomes a widow when King Joffrey Baratheon is murdered at their wedding feast and worries she will not be married to his younger brother and successor Tommen, her grandmother Olenna recounts the story of how she escaped her engagement to Daeron as a lesson on how to manipulate Tommen into wanting their marriage.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Olenna Tyrell tells Sansa Stark over supper at their first meeting about how she ended her betrothal to a Targaryen prince, but he is never specifically named. 

In The World of Ice and Fire companion book, this Prince is revealed as Daeron Targaryen, the youngest son of King Aegon V Targaryen. The World of Ice and Fire changes that Olenna was not the one to breakoff the betrothal, but Daeron himself because he preferred the companionship of Ser Jeremy Norridge, a young knight that he befriended while squiring together at Highgarden. The two later die together in battle quashing a small rebellion. 

In Games of Thrones Season 1 finale episode Maester Aemon says King Aegon V Targaryen was his younger brother and Aegon V's successor was his son King Aerys II Targaryen better known as the Mad King. In A Song of Ice and Fire novels the Mad King's father was King Jaehaerys II Targaryen, King Aegon V's second son and Prince Daeron's older brother. Removing this generation from Games of Thrones canon makes conjecture based off the A Song of Ice and Fire novels and The World of Ice and Fire companion book more difficult.
