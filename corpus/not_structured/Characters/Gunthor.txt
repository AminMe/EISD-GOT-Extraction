Contents[show] BiographyEdit Season 1Edit 

Tyrion reports to his father and his uncle that Ulf, of the Moon Brothers, is demanding blood money from Shagga, of the Stone Crows. Shagga, Gunthor, and a third Stone Crow had killed a Moon Brother after the latter stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Gunthor&nbsp;son of Gurn, along with Shagga son of Dolf, and other clansmen, meet Tyrion and Bronn&nbsp;in the Mountains of the Moon. In the novel, Gunthor is the first to introduce himself to Tyrion by saying Shagga's TV-series line: "When you meet your gods, say it was Gunthor son of Gurn of the Stone Crows who sent you to them."&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, instead of departing with&nbsp;Tyrion&nbsp;to the Lannister&nbsp;camp, Gunthor stays behind at the Mountains to rally the members of the hill tribes. 

Later, when&nbsp;Sandor Clegane&nbsp;and&nbsp;Arya Stark&nbsp;arrive in the Vale, they are told that hill tribes, including the Stone Crows led by Gunthor, are robbing and killing in the area.
