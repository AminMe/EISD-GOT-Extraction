Joffrey's younger brother 
Margaery's 3rd husband In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, his family remains the same. Garlan is married to Lady Leonette of&nbsp;House Fossoway, but they do not yet have any children. He is a taller, bearded version of his brother Ser Loras Tyrell, but less handsome. He is five years older than Ser Loras. He is an exceptionally skilled swordsman, usually training against three or four swordsmen, practice for actual battle, but his lack of interest in gaining glory makes him less famous than his younger brother, Ser Loras. He is known as Garlan the Gallant and his personal coat of arms is two golden roses on green. 

In the books, it is Garlan and not Loras the one who rides wearing Renly Baratheon's armor during the Battle of the Blackwater because the late King's armor fit Garlan better than it fit Loras. Garlan is the one who requests that Joffrey marry Margaery, while Loras asks to be a Kingsguard. 

Garlan danced with Sansa Stark at her wedding. Noticing how unhappy she was to be married against her will, he treated her very kindly and gently, and even made her laugh by mentioning the ridiculous nicknames he was called as a child. That cheered her spirit a bit. Garlan told her "I have seen how you look at my brother. Loras is valiant and handsome, and we all love him dearly... but your Imp will make a better husband". Garlan perhaps meant to imply by that Sansa wouldn't be happy married to Loras, even if that was possible, due to his sexual preference. 

Garlan is one of the only two people (the second is Lancel Lannister) who praise Tyrion for his valor in the Battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion is grateful to hear this. 

At the Purple Wedding, Garlan and his wife sit next to Tyrion and Sansa. When Joffrey spills wine on Tyrion, Garlan protests "That was ill done, Your Grace". As Joffrey collapses, Garlan is the first who rushes to help him.
