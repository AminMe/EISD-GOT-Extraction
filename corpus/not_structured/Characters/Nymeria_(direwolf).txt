Nymeria defends Arya 

Nymeria was adopted as a pup along with the rest of her siblings when Eddard Stark and his entourage came upon the pups and their deceased mother. At the request of Jon Snow, the pups were spared a quick death and each Stark child adopted one as their own. Arya names her direwolf after a fearsome warrior-queen.

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, "Nymeria" is pronounced "Nigh-MEER-ee-uh", as opposed to "Nih-MER-ee-uh".
