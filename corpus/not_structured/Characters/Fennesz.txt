Fennesz Season(s) 4 First seen "The Children" Status Alive Origin Meereen Culture Ghiscari Portrayed by Trevor Allan Davies "The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them, but for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor." ―Fennesz to Daenerys Targaryen[src]​Fennesz is a character introduced in the last episode of the fourth season. He is played by Trevor Allan Davies. Contents[show] BackgroundEdit 

Fennesz was a slave in the service of Master Mighdal, one of the Great Masters of Meereen, and charged with educating the children of the household. In his own opinion, he was well treated by his master and loved by the children he taught. He speaks several languages, including Valyrian and the Common Tongue, and knows the history of House Targaryen. BiographyEdit Season 4Edit 

Some time after her army took Meereen and freed all the slaves, Daenerys Targaryen receives Fennesz at court. He tells her how, in his view, his life became much harder since she "freed" him; he was well-treated and even well-respected in the household, but now he is living on the streets, as the living conditions in the barracks established for the homeless freedmen are terrible. Daenerys is surprised, but eventually allows Fennesz -- and others -- to enter into a contract of employment with his former owner, lasting no more than one year. The old man thanks her and leaves. AppearancesEdit Season Four appearances Two Swords The Lion and the Rose Breaker of Chains Oathkeeper First of His Name The Laws of Gods and Men Mockingbird The Mountain and the Viper The Watchers on the Wall The Children In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no such character. The TV character is a condensation to represent what is happening to many slaves in Meereen: 

When Xaro Xhoan Daxos (who is still alive in the books) visits Daenerys, he scoffs at her attempts to abolish slavery in Meereen and declares that the condition of the ex-slaves she freed is now much worse than before, being forced to perform manual chores that do not fit their skills. As an example, he tells about a friend of his that used to be a rich merchant who dealt with rare spices and choice wines, and now he digs ditches. He begged Xaro to buy him as a slave and take him to Qarth. The role of Fennesz is roughly the same as the ex-slaves that Xaro talked about.
