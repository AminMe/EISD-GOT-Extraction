 "Such a little thing. A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again." ―Cersei Lannister[src] 

Cersei's black-haired son is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is deceased when the events of the series begin and is not expected to appear in the series. He is first mentioned by Cersei Lannister in "The Kingsroad". Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Cersei's black-haired son is her first-born child, and the only of her children whose father is King Robert Baratheon. Very little is known about him: that he had black hair; resembled Robert a lot; and died as a result of a fever. His name, year of birth and age at the point of his demise are unknown. Season 1Edit 

When Catelyn Stark watches over Bran, who has not woken up after having fell from the tower, Cersei comes to visit. She tells Catelyn that years ago she has lost her first boy, a little black-haired beauty. She and Robert were nearly driven mad by the child's death. 

Robert and Cersei talk about the imminent Dothraki's invasion and their unhappy marriage. Cersei says that she has felt something for Robert once, even after they lost their first boy, for quite a while.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cersei never gave birth to any of Robert's children. When Eddard Stark confronts her about the identity of the father of her children, she admits that Jaime is their father, and that she loathes Robert since their first night, for coming to their bed drunk and calling her by Lyanna's name. She also reveals that Robert got her pregnant once, and her brother found a woman that could end the pregnancy. Robert was unaware of both the pregnancy and the abortion.
