 In the booksEdit 

In the&nbsp;A Song of Ice and Fire ​novels, the kennelmaster lost three hounds and a leg in the process of saving Lord Tytos. As a reward, Lord Tytos gave him lands and a towerhouse and took his son as his squire. Their sigil is three dogs on a yellow field; the three dogs represent the dogs that died saving Lord Tytos. 

So far, his actual name hasn't been mentioned in the books. 

The lion's attack on Lord Tytos was considered quite unusual, given that lions are thought to be extinct in the mountains of the Westerlands - though a few lions are kept at Casterly Rock. The great lions of the Westerlands were once fairly common, enough that the ancient Lannisters took them as their sigil thousands of years ago. Human encroachment over the centuries, however, gradually led to the number of lions dwindling. ReferencesEdit ↑ "House Clegane (Histories &amp; Lore)"
