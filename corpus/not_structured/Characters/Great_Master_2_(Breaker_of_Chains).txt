He is one of the many Great Masters that gather over the walls of Meereen when Daenerys Targaryen and her army appear before the city gates to lay siege to the city. After the death of Meereenese champion Oznak zo Pahl and Daenerys' words to the slaves present, he looks in confusion as a slave picks up one of the hundreds of broken slave collars thrown into the city in catapulted barrels. After Daenerys sacks the city, she orders the crucifixion of the great masters of Meereen as justice for the 163 slave children nailed to sign-posts on the road from Yunkai to Meereen. It is evident that this Great Master was one of the Great Masters killed.
