He was a fisherman from Lannisport conscripted into the force led by Ser Stafford Lannister. Season 2Edit 

He participates in the Battle of Oxcross, in which his leg is wounded. He is treated for an infected wound by Talisa Maegyr. Though he begs for her not to, she amputates the leg, telling him that not doing so would kill him. Robb Stark, who had noticed Talisa, helps to hold him down, forcing him to bite down on&nbsp;a piece of leather. Afterward, he is loaded onto a cart and taken away. 

Talisa blames Robb for the boy losing his leg, explaining that he isn't responsible for the death of Eddard Stark and isn't friends with King Joffrey Baratheon, and that he was a fisherman from Lannisport before they forced a spear in his hand. Robb tells Talisa that the boy was lucky she was there, but she says he was unlucky Robb was.
