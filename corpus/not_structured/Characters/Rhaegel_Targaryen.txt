Deceased In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Prince Rhaegel was the third son of King Daeron the Good and Queen Myriah. He was sickly, meek, and insane. He was known for dancing naked through the halls of the Red Keep. He was married to Lady Alys Arryn and had three children, twins Aelor and Aelora, and daughter Daenora. 

He was named Prince of Dragonstone when his brother Aerys I ascended the Iron Throne since Aerys had no children of his own. He later died when he choked on a lamprey pie. His son Aelor became the new Prince of Dragonstone, but he himself died in a mishap at the hands of his sister-wife Aelora. This left her made with grief and she later took her own life after being assaulted at a masked ball. Daenora was married to her cousin Prince Aerion Targaryen and had a son named Maegor.
