Josera and Elsera, as the bastard children of Gregor, were his hidden shame. Because of this, he sent them beyond the Wall to the North Grove to protect it. "The Ice Dragon"Edit 

As they approach the North Grove, Gared, Cotter, and Sylvi are attacked by Josera's snow bear, Shadow. They manage to fend it off long enough to reach the grove, where his sister Elsera forces him to stop attacking the group. The three newcomers are held at knifepoint, until Gared reveals that he was sent by House Forrester. Josera disbelieves his claim, even after he presents proof, but Elsera urges her brother to trust the squire. The two give their names, and Gared then reveals that he came to the North Grove because of Gregor's last words him. Josera is shocked to learn of Gregor's death, and angered that Gared doesn't know the identity of himself and his sister. Before they have time to talk further, the group learns of wights approaching the grove and move to defend it. Josera has Sylvi tied up, but Gared can convince him to free her. They then move to confront the threat. 

While going to fight the wights, Elsera reveals to Gared that she and Josera are the bastard children of Gregor. Josera believes Gregor banished them to hide his shame. Upon arriving at a clearing, Josera wargs into Shadow and prepares to fight the wights. He takes out several during the ensuing melee. Gared defends his human body in the meantime, taking out Finn as a wight if he was killed in the previous episode. The group comes out victorious, and Josera gruffly thanks Gared for his help. He will ask about Finn if he appeared, and reassures Gared that his death was not his fault. 

One of Elsera's soldiers then stops obeying her orders, and attacks her. Josera moves to kill it, but Elsera manages to get it under control. Josera tells Gared that she controls the soldiers through blood magic, and that her power over them is growing weaker. Now aware of Gregor's death and the peril House Forrester faces, Josera expresses a desire to abandon the North Grove and march south to help his family.&nbsp; 

Josera is later present for the burning of Cotter's body. If Gared chose to give him the nightshade, Josera will tell him that he did the right thing. Josera then reiterates his desire to go south to help the Forresters. Gared is given the choice to stay and defend the North Grove or travel back to the Seven Kingdoms. Josera will go along with whatever he decides. Family TreeEdit &nbsp; &nbsp; Thorren Forrester
