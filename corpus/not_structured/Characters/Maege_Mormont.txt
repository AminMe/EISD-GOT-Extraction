In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lady Maege, also known as "the She-Bear", is a stout, grey-haired woman and a fierce warrior. She dresses in mail and her favored weapon is a spiked mace. Catelyn Stark observes that Maege seems more comfortable in armor than Brienne of Tarth ever did. According to her brother Jeor, she is stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. She worked hard to regain the family's noble name and recover from the state of near-poverty her nephew Jorah had left behind. 

When Robb Stark calls his bannerman to march south after Eddard Stark's arrest and they start to test him due his youth, Maege tells Robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson, and had no business giving her commands, but she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry. Maege is more understanding of Catelyn Stark releasing Ser Jaime Lannister, and Catelyn has grown fond of her. Maege does not attend the Red Wedding, as along the way from Riverrun to the Twins, Robb commands her and Galbart Glover to take men by separate longships and sail through the marshes of the Neck to seek out Howland Reed. He gives them letters for the Northern lords, explaining the letters contain false orders, in case they are captured by the ironborn. It remains unknown if Maege or Galbart Glover reached their destination. 

Maege has five children, all daughters: Dacey, Alysane, Lyra, Jorelle, and Lyanna. Lyanna is only ten years old during the fourth and fifth novels. Alysane had a son and daughter by an unknown father. Dacey was a warrior-woman like her mother and sisters and a member of Robb Stark's personal guard; she was killed during the Red Wedding. Dacey was one of the few of Robb's bannermen who managed to get to her feet, fighting off Benfrey Frey by smashing his face in with a wine flagon. She then made a death run for the feast hall's doors and managed to avoid being shot by the crossbowmen in the balcony, but just before she reached the door, Ryman Frey and a dozen more fully armed Frey men-at-arms came bursting through it and ran right into her. Dacey died when Ryman drove his longaxe into her stomach.
