In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Arya is betrothed to Elmar Frey. The character has been renamed for the television series. Elmar is the twenty-second son of Lord Walder Frey and the fourth born to Lord Walder's seventh wife, Annara Farring. Elmar is the older brother of Shirei Frey, the youngest child that Lord Walder had with Annara Farring. He is nine years old. 

Elmar encounters Arya several times in Harrenhal and tries to boss her around, while mentioning proudly that he is trueborn son of lord Walder Frey and is going to marry a princess - both of them are unaware that Arya is that princess. Arya is not impressed and does not comply to him. After being informed that Robb Stark breached the pact with the Freys, Elmar tells Arya whiningly that his father told him he had to marry someone else, or to become a septon. Arya has no sympathy to him.
