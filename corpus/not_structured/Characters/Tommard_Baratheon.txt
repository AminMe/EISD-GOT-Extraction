Staff writer Bryan Cogman came up with the idea of the stillborn fetuses being preserved in jars. Cogman said in an interview, "It was a proud day for me as a writer when I walked on set and saw those magnificently nasty prop dead babies floating in those jars." In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire book series, there is no mention Selyse Baratheon having any sons, live or stillborn. ReferencesEdit ↑ HBO: Game of Thrones: Interview With Bryan Cogman Retrieved from "http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tommard_Baratheon?oldid=232341"
