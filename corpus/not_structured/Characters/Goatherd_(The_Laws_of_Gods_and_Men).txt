In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Daenerys hears cases from several shepherds and goatherds of their livestock being carried away by her dragons, all of whom are promised fair compensation for their losses. As the number of claims increase, some of them are false, so Daenerys decrees that claimants must present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and swear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis that their claims are genuine.
