Walda&nbsp;is a grandniece of Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing. Season 1Edit 

While waiting outside the Twins, Robb Stark has Theon Greyjoy shoot down any ravens sent out to prevent Lord Walder from alerting the House Lannister of his army's movements. One raven turns out to be carrying a birthday message to Walda, though Theon speculates it may be a coded message with some other significance. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, many members of House Frey name their daughters Walda&nbsp;in an attempt to please Lord Walder. However, there's no mention of any grandniece of Lord Walder. There's also no mention of any siblings.
