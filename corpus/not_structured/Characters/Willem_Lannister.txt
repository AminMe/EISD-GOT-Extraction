Willem Lannister is a character in the third season. Along with his brother Martyn, he is a squire in the Lannister army. Both are younger sons of Kevan Lannister, and younger brothers of Lancel Lannister. Contents[show] BiographyEdit Season 3Edit 

Willem, along with his brother Martyn, is captured by the forces of House Tully led by Edmure Tully following the Battle of Stone Mill. The two are kept as hostages at Riverrun, the seat of the Tullys. 

After Robb Stark visits Riverrun to attend the funerals of Lord Hoster Tully, Willem and Martyn are visited in their cell by Queen Talisa Stark, who tends to Martyn's wounded hand. Willem looks in silence while Martyn asks if the tales told among the Lannisters about Robb turning into a wolf at night or devouring his enemies are true. 

Martyn and Willem are murdered inside their cells by Lord Rickard Karstark in retribution for his&nbsp;son being killed by Jaime Lannister, and in defiance of Robb Stark's orders.&nbsp;Rickard is consequently executed for treason by Robb, causing the Karstarks to desert Robb's cause.
