Deceased In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aelinor is not mentioned precisely as Aerys I's sister-wife, though it was assumed by fandom she was a Targaryen due to the custom of dynastic incest. The prop of the Lineages book that Eddard reads in Season 1 of the TV series (written by Bryan Cogman) also made this assumpetion. 

In The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook, however, it is revealed that she was actually a member of House Penrose, a noble house from the Stormlands, as well as a cousin to House Targaryen. This information was only released in 2014, after Season 1. So far there has been no official update to her status in the TV continuity.
