In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Melara Hetherspoon is a daughter of Ser Tybolt Hetherspoon, the head of House Hetherspoon, and a childhood friend of Cersei Lannister. She's described as pretty but freckled, and "healthy as a horse". Unlike her portrayal in the series, Melara is described as bold, whereas the reluctant companion of Cersei and Melara is Jeyne Farman, who flees Maggy's tent the minute the woman opens her eyes. Like Cersei, Melara also asks about her future, asking if she will someday marry Jaime Lannister. In the series, the flashback ends before the audience learns if Melara asks her future.
