He is one of five dwarfs hired by King Joffrey to re-enact the War of the Five Kings during the Purple Wedding. He dresses as Stannis Baratheon and rides a mount resembling Melisandre.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there are only two dwarfs jousting. They ride live animals, a dog and a sow. The one meant as a mockery of Stannis bears a shield depicting the black stag on yellow of House Baratheon. Stannis is also vilified in a song by Galyeon of Cuy, which depicts Stannis as an envious and evil man, bordering on an stereotypical fantasy evil overlord, planning on usurping the Seven Kingdoms.
