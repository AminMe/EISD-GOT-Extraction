No army could stand against them... because the Dothraki do not stand." ―Ser Jorah Mormont[src] 

Temmo was a Dothraki khal who embarked on a vast campaign of plunder four hundred years before the War of the Five Kings, in the chaos following the Doom of Valyria. 

Without the Valyrians and their dragons to keep them in check, the Dothraki swept across Essos. During this time Temmo commanded a khalasar numbering in the tens of thousands. 

Temmo was finally stopped, however, by a force of 3,000 Unsullied warrior-eunuchs during the Battle of Qohor. The Dothraki could easily have outflanked the Unsullied, but by tradition they scorn infantry, and thinking of them as easily ridden down. On this occasion, however, the lockstep phalanxes of the Unsullied held firm, and fearlessly resisted his khalasar's assaults. By the end of the battle only 600 Unsullied remained, but 12,000 Dothraki had been killed, including Temmo and his sons. Defeated, the surviving Dothraki cut off their braids and threw them at the feet of the Unsullied, to mark their shame, and departed.
