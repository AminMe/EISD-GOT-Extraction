Jonquil Season(s) 2 Mentioned in "A Man Without Honor" Status Deceased 

Jonquil is an unseen character mentioned in the second season. Jonquil is the heroine of a legend. According to the legend, she was the lover of Florian, a foolish knight who fell in love with her when he saw her bathing with her sisters in Maidenpool. Season 2Edit 

Tywin Lannister points out to Arya Stark that most girls are primarily interested in the pretty maidens from the songs, like Jonquil, and tying flowers in their hair. Arya is more interested in warrior-princesses, like Visenya Targaryen, than pretty maidens in epic romances like Jonquil, and feels that "most girls" are idiots, much to Lord Tywin's amusement.
