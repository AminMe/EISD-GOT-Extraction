In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aeron Greyjoy presides over Theon's baptism, and he does this as soon as Theon arrives in Pyke, before taking him to the castle. Given that Aeron "Damphair" Greyjoy is Theon's uncle and an important character in later books in the series, the producers wanted to forgo having to make a major casting decision until his main storyline begins. Aeron is set to appear in the sixth season. See AlsoEdit
