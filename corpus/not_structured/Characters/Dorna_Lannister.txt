In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Dorna is the daughter of Ser Harys Swyft, the Knight of Cornfield and a loyal bannerman of House Lannister. Her father married her to Kevan Lannister and they have three sons: Lancel and the twins Martyn and Willem. They also have a daughter, Janei. Lancel is their eldest child and Janei the youngest. 

According to Kevan, Dorna is a gentle soul, never comfortable except at home with friends and kin around her. She prays seven times a day and loves needlework and flowers. 

Dorna is described "chinless lady, flat-chested and chicken-legged" with her lack of chin shared by her father, yet she is still very loved by her husband. 

It is unclear from Robert's comment about Dorna being a "dumb whore with a fat arse" whether her physical description was changed in the series (as done with many characters) or he called her that way just to insult Lancel.
