"Kill the Boy" Origin Meereen Allegiance Great Masters Culture Ghiscari Portrayed by Gianpiero Cognoli 

This former Great Master is a minor character in the fifth season. He is played by Gianpiero Cognoli and only appears in "Kill the Boy". He is a citizen of Meereen and head of the ancient noble families of the city. Contents[show] Behind the scenes Edit 

The character was originally listed as "Master Eaton" in the actor's CV, however "Eaton" doesn't fit the established naming conventions of the Ghiscari of Slaver's Bay. Some CV's have already shown typing mistakes in character names, in this case a case of misreading "Eaten master" or "Maester eaten", in reference to the character's fate. In the books Edit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels there is no equivalent character. Daenerys doesn't have the head of the ancient slaver families arrested as a reaction to the murders carried out by the Sons of the Harpy. Instead, she has each family of dubious loyalty deliver a child hostage, hoping this will diminish the violence. When this measure fails, Dany's counselor and noted loyalist Skahaz mo Kandaq urges her to kill a hostage for every murder of the Sons but she still refuses to harm them.
