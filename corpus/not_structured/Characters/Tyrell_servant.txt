The&nbsp;Tyrell servant is a minor character in the third season. He is portrayed by Will Rastall and appears in "Dark Wings, Dark Words". Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

He works as a food server for House Tyrell in King's Landing. He wears the same color and fabric as the rest of House Tyrell's servants, suggesting he was brought from Highgarden&nbsp;and not simply employed by the Red Keep. Season 3Edit 

He waits on Olenna Tyrell and her retinue when Margaery Tyrell arrives to introduce Sansa Stark to her grandmother so they can learn about King Joffrey Baratheon's true character. Lady Olenna demands to know if he intends to bring them food or starve them to death. A few minutes later, she berates him for insisting that he follow protocol and only serve cheese after the lemon cakes, and orders him to bring her the cheese dish immediately. Her harsh treatment of him may have been to ensure he was not present during Sansa's confession.
