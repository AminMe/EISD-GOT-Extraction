Domeric Bolton has only been indirectly mentioned in press interviews by Iwan Rheon and Michael McElhatton as well as George R.R. Martin in the "Bastards of Westeros" promotional video. 

"Iron From Ice", episode 1 of Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series, features cut dialogue of Ramsay mentioning Domeric's death to Ethan Forrester and his mother, remarking sarcastically that he "fell ill" and mockingly expressing sorrow. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Domeric Bolton was the only son and heir of Lord Roose Bolton and Lady Bethany Ryswell, his second wife. According to Roose, Domeric was quiet but accomplished; he read history, played the harp and rode horses as if born on the saddle. Domeric's mother's younger sister, Lady Barbrey Dustin, was quite fond of him as he had served as a page for her at Barrowton. He also served as a squire for Lord Redfort&nbsp;in the Vale, who said Domeric had the makings of a tournament champion. Domeric enjoyed the company of Redfort's sons in the Vale and, longing for a brother of his own, rode up the Weeping Water to seek out his bastard half-brother despite his father's forbidding it. 

According to the Dreadfort's maester, Uthor, Domeric died of a sickness of the bowels. Roose and Lady Dustin, among others, strongly suspect Ramsay murdered Domeric with poison to take his place as Roose's heir.
