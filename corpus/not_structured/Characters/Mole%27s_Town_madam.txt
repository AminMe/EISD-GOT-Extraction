She runs the brothel in Mole's Town. Season 4Edit 

When Samwell Tarly brings Gilly and Sam to stay at the brothel, he tells the madam that Gilly will clean, cook and look after the other girls' babies.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Gilly is never taken to Mole's Town to seek refuge, as Gilly and Sam arrive at Castle Black much later into the storyline after the battle is over, without passing through the village, which is abandoned at that point. 

The books mention three whores of Mole's Town: Zei, Lady Meliana, and Sky Blue Su. They are among the villagers who come to seek refuge at Castle Black. None of them interacts with Gilly. Since very little information is given about them, it is unknown if the madam in the TV show is based on any of them.
