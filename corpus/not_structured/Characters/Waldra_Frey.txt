Waldra Frey&nbsp;is one of the many daughters of Walder Frey. She only appears in the Season 3 episode "The Rains of Castamere". Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Waldra is one of the many daughters of Walder Frey, the Lord of the Crossing. Season 3Edit 

Along with several of Lord Frey's other daughters and granddaughters, Robb Stark had the option of marrying her. When he arrives at the Twins for his uncle Edmure's&nbsp;wedding, Robb apologizes&nbsp;for his slight against them. AppearancesEdit Season Three appearances Valar Dohaeris Dark Wings, Dark Words Walk of Punishment And Now His Watch is Ended Kissed by Fire The Climb The Bear and the Maiden Fair Second Sons The Rains of Castamere Mhysa In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, some of Lord Walder's descendants name their offspring Walder or Walda to incur Lord Walder's favor - a custom the Lord of the Crossing finds annoying. There's no mention of a daughter of Lord Walder named "Waldra" (apparently a variant of "Walda"), nor of any of his granddaughters or great-granddaughters having the name "Waldra".
