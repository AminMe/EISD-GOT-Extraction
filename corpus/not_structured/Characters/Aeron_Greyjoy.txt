A Drowned Priest appears in the second season but has been confirmed as not being Aeron. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Aeron is known as Damphair and is a priest of the Drowned God. He is tall and thin with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose. He garbs himself in roughspun robes dyed in the green, grey, and blue of the Drowned God. He never cuts his hair, which falls to his waist and he weaves seaweed into it. 

In his youth, Aeron was an unruly ribald drunk who often came at odds with his brother Balon. During the Greyjoy Rebellion, he nearly drowned when his ship was sunk by Stannis Baratheon. He washed ashore and was imprisoned at Lannisport. After being released, he had changed significantly due to his near-death experience, and became very pious and devoted to the worship of the Drowned God. He is well respected and has great influence among the ironborn. 

Aeron sometimes has nightmares about a door with screeching hinges, which he associates with his brother Euron. 

In the novel, when Theon returns to the Pyke&nbsp;from the North, it is Aeron who greets him first and almost immediately baptizes him at his arrival. 

Martin repeatedly gets asked in Q&amp;A sessions how "Damphair" is pronounced, to which he has repeatedly had to explain that it is simply "damp hair" because he has long hair and wades into the sea much of the time (a surprisingly large number of people for some reason assumed that the "ph" that happens to be next to each other are meant to be pronounced as an "F").
