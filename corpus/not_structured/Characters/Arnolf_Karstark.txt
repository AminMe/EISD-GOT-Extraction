In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, after Rickard Karstark is executed the Karstark forces abandon Robb Stark and ride back to the North, where they are led by Rickard's uncle Arnolf Karstark. Casting reports have confirmed that a "Lord Karstark" will appear in Season 6, but haven't confirmed his first name yet - he may have been condensed with other characters. This article is titled "Arnolf Karstark" as a placeholder until more information is available. 

Arnolf is introduced in the fifth novel. He is not a lord but the castellan of Karhold. He is described as thin and twisted, one of his shoulders is much higher than the other. His eyes are grey and greedy, his teeth yellow, his forked beard a tangle of snow and silver. Only a few wisps of white hair still cling to his spotted skull. He wears a cloak of grey wool trimmed with black sable and fastened at the shoulder with a starburst wrought in beaten silver. 

In the novels, Rickard Karstark had three sons: his eldest son and heir Harrion was captured after the Battle of Duskendale, while his other two sons Torrhen and Eddard were killed in the war. Rickard also has a daughter named Alys. 

The TV series changed this around somewhat: instead of Torrhen and Eddard dying, it is stated that Harrion and Torrhen died, and no mention is made of Eddard Karstark - possibly to avoid the confusion of introducing another character named "Eddard" after Eddard Stark (though George R.R. Martin's entire point in reusing character names is because he thought it was contrived that there would be no repeated first names in an entire continent). In the novels, Harrion remains a prisoner of the Lannisters in the south, while Rickard's uncle Arnolf comes to power back at Karhold. He becomes fairly important in the politics of the Northern storyline, because the Karstarks are the only Northern House (besides the Boltons) whose military strength is relatively intact, having been absent from the Red Wedding.
