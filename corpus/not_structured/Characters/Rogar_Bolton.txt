Rogar Bolton - also known as Rogar the Huntsman - was the last Red King of the Dreadfort. Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Rogar Bolton was the the last head of House Bolton who ruled as a petty king. He bent the knee to House Stark, forswearing the practice of flaying as a sign of allegiance to his new king. In the booksEdit 

Rogar Bolton was the last of the Red Kings of House Bolton, who ruled their own independent kingdom in the eastern parts of what later became "the North", and vied with the Starks for control over the rest of it. Rogar Bolton submitted to the Starks just as the Andal Invasion was beginning in southern Westeros, meaning that he lived roughly 6,000 years ago.
