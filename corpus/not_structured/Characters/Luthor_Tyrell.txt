Luthor Tyrell is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is deceased when the events of the series begin and is not expected to appear in the series. He is mentioned by his widow Olenna Tyrell in "Dark Wings, Dark Words". Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Luthor Tyrell is the father of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and the head of House Tyrell. He is survived by his widow Olenna Tyrell, known as the "Queen of Thorns". 

In his youth, Luthor was expected to marry Viola Redwyne. The night before he was due to propose to her, however, Viola's sister Olenna "stumbled" upon his bedchamber after allegedly getting lost after her embroidery lesson. The next morning, Luthor did not propose to Viola; in fact, he never left his chamber, as he couldn't walk, and could only think of what Olenna had given him the night before. Season 3Edit 

Lord Luthor's widow, Lady Olenna, describes her late husband to&nbsp;Sansa Stark&nbsp;as "an oaf". &nbsp;She explains that her husband died when he rode&nbsp;over a cliff while hawking. He had been looking up and not paying attention to where his horse was going. She used the incident as a metaphor for the Tyrells' alliance with the Lannisters. Season 4Edit 

After Joffrey is poisoned and dies right in front of Margaery, she is left somewhat shaken. Days later, wearing mourning clothes, Olenna recalls to her that Luthor was an oaf she had to sit through boring banquets with and produce heirs with - but it was still horrifying after he died in his hunting accident, when they brought him back and she saw his lifeless corpse laid out on a table. Olenna seems uncharacteristically a little upset, though she tries to hide it, as she clearly didn't rejoice when Luthor died. Family treeEdit &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Luthor Tyrell

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Luthor Tyrell's backstory remains the same, except that there is no mentioning if he ever has been betrothed to any other woman before his marriage to Olenna. 

After short conversation with Olenna, Tyrion Lannister wondered if Luthor deliberately rode off that cliff.
