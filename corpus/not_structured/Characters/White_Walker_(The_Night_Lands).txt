A White Walker retrieves a baby left in the Haunted Forest as a sacrifice by Craster, a wildling that worships the White Walkers and sacrifices his male offspring to them. Jon Snow witnesses the incident and is quickly knocked out by Craster. Behind the ScenesEdit 

This White Walker was played by Ian Whyte, who also played the White Walker in the series premiere, "Winter is Coming". There's no indication that they're meant to be the same White Walker, though it is possible. A different White Walker, played by Ross Mullan, retrieved Craster's last son in Oathkeeper, though again, it is possible that the same White Walker has been tasked with retrieving all Craster's sons.
