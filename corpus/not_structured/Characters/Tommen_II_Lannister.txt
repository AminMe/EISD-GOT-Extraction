Tommen II Lannister is a character in Game of Thrones. He is long dead by the time the series take place so it is unlikely he will ever appear. Tommen II Lannister was a member of House Lannister who ruled the Westerlands as King of the Rock. Contents[show] Biography Edit History Edit 

Tommen Lannister, the Second of His Name, ruled the Kingdom of the Rock after the Doom of Valyria. He led an expedition to the Valyrian Peninsula from which he never returned. He carried with him the Valyrian steel sword Brightroar, which was lost with him. In the books Edit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels King Tommen II is briefly mentioned. In The World of Ice and Fire his story is briefly expanded. The last report of him is a&nbsp;Volantene chronicle titled&nbsp;The Glory of Volantis&nbsp;which mentions a "golden fleet" bearing the "Lion King" stayed at Volantis for supplies, and the that&nbsp;triarchs&nbsp;showered him with gifts. According to the chronicle, Tommen II swore that half of all he would find would be given to the triarchs in return for their generosity and the promise to send their fleet to his aid when he requested it. Afterward he sailed away. The next year, the chronicle states that Triarch&nbsp;Marqelo Tagaros&nbsp;dispatched a squadron toward Valyria to find any sign of Tommen's golden fleet but returned empty handed. 

Tommen II apparently lived a few years or few decades after the Doom of Valyria, which was itself a century before the Targaryen Conquest of Westeros. It is said that the Lannnisters acquired Brightroar in the century before the Doom, and that Tommen II disappeared a little over a century after that.
