Willem Darry ​was&nbsp;a knight of House Darry that remained loyal to House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion. Contents[show] BiographyEdit 

Following the Sack of King's Landing and the birth of Daenerys Targaryen, Ser Willem smuggled Viserys and Daenerys across the Narrow Sea to the Free Cities before Stannis Baratheon arrived to seize Dragonstone. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Willem Darry was the master-at-arms at the Red Keep and the brother of Ser Jonothor Darry of the Kingsguard. He was a grey bear of a man who was half-blind. He had a gruff, kind voice and big wrinkled hands, soft as old leather. 

After the Mad King's death in the Sack of King's Landing and Queen Rhaella's death during labor, the garrison of Dragonstone considered selling Viserys and the infant Daenerys, to the new king. However, before they could come to a decision, Ser Willem and four loyal men smuggled Viserys and Daenerys from the island and fled to safety in Braavos. However, Ser Willem was old and some years later he became sick and died, leaving Viserys and Daenerys to fend for themselves.
