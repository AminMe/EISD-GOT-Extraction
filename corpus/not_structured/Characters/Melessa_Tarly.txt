Lady Melessa of House Florent is the wife Lord Randyll Tarly of Horn Hill and mother of Samwell Tarly of the Night's Watch. She is a cousin of Selyse Florent, the wife of Stannis Baratheon, and Ser Imry Florent. Season 1Edit 

When Jon Snow asks Samwell what he is doing at the Wall, Samwell tells him that his father did not think him manly enough to inherit his title and lands so he forced him to join the Night's Watch or he implied that he would kill him and tell Melessa that it was a hunting accident. Season 2Edit 

Before leaving Craster's Keep, Samwell Tarly gives Gilly a thimble that once belonged to Lady Melessa. He explains that he used to read to her while she was sewing but that his father ended the practice when he found out. He reveals that the thimble is the only possession he has from her and that it was a gift given when he left for the Wall.
