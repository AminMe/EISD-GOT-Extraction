In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Arya tries to trade the pigeon to a man selling pies, first asking for lemon, but then any kind. When he refuses, she considers grabbing it and running as the man has a limp, but as there are gold cloaks patrolling nearby she thinks better of it. Earlier she had been successful in trading pigeons she caught to a pot-shop (apparently as an ingredient in bowls of brown), which in return would give her back half of the pigeon's meat cooked - before this, she had to eat the pigeon meat raw.
