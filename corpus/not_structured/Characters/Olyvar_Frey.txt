In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Olyvar is the eighteenth son of Lord Walder overall and the fourth born to Lord Walder's sixth wife, Bethany Rosby. His three older brothers are Perwyn, Benfrey, Willamen, and his younger sister is Roslin. He is two years older than Robb Stark although he is very immature compared to Robb. He takes part in the Battle of the Whispering Wood. 

When Robb breaks his marriage pact with House Frey, Olyvar wants to remain with him but is forced by his siblings to leave Robb. Olyvar is kept in the dark about his father's plan to betray and kill Robb Stark at the Red Wedding. It was feared that he was too loyal to Robb, and would try to warn him or even to defend him when the ambush commenced, so he is sent away from the Twins "on duty".
