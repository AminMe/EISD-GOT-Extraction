In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ronnel's family was unchanged. Ronnel died around the same time his son Elbert was born, however, Elbert himself died when he was executed by the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen alongside Rickard and Brandon Stark at the beginning of Robert's Rebellion, extinguishing Ronnel's line.
