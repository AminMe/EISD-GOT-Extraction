Baelish is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is deceased when the events of the series begin. He is not expected to appear in the series. He is the grandfather of major character Petyr Baelish. BiographyEdit 

He was a poor wandering hedge knight, who eventually was rewarded for his services with a small portion of land and a keep - a tiny, hardscrabble holding in the smallest peninsula of the Fingers. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, he took the head of the Titan of Braavos as his sigil when he was knighted. His arms were a grey stone head with fiery eyes on a light green field.
