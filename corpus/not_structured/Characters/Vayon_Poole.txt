Vayon's daughter, Jeyne 

Vayon Poole serves House Stark as the Steward of Winterfell. He is the father of&nbsp;five daughters, one of whom, Jeyne Poole, is Sansa Stark's friend. Season 1Edit 

When Maester Luwin approaches Catelyn Stark to talk about the costs of the royal visit to Winterfell and the need to replace the members of the household that accompanied Lord Eddard to King's Landing, she, grieving for Bran, tells Luwin to have Poole see to the task. Luwin notes that Poole also went south with Lord Stark. 

Poole is later killed by Lannister men during the purge of the Stark household ordered by King Joffrey after Lord Stark tries to remove him from the throne. He dies while he and his men are packing for an evacuation Ned had ordered in anticipation of his move against Joffrey.
