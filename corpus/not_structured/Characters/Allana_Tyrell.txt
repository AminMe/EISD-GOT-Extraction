Allana Tyrell is an unseen character in the third season. She is the cousin of Margaery Tyrell. Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Allana is a member of House Tyrell. Season 3Edit 

Allana is mentioned by her cousin Margaery while chatting with Sansa Stark. According to Margaery, when she was 12, she was very clumsy and Allana looked like a goddess sent to torture her. Allana used to call Margaery "Pig-face", and whenever she passed Margaery in the halls, she'd oink, so Margaery prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. Margaery tells Sansa that a week after that, Allana came down with "porridge plague". Only when Margaery bursts out laughing, Sansa understands it is a joke. Sansa asks what has become of Allana, and Margaery answers that she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. Margaery finds this very frustrating, but Sansa assures her that Allana must be very jealous of her, now that she is going to become a queen.  In the booksEdit
