Maegor III Targaryen is an unseen character in Game of Thrones. He is long dead by the time of the series. He was a King of the Targaryen dynasty. Biography 

At some point Maegor the Third tried to outlaw the practice of usury, and cut off both the hands of anyone caught charging interest on loans. In the books 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, there is no such character. Indeed, there has never been any other member of House Targaryen named Maegor since the infamous "Maegor the Cruel", such was Maegor's repute that later members of the house deliberately shunned the name. So far, it is unknown if the mention of the name is a deliberate choice by the production, a mistake from the writers, or a mistake from the actor.
