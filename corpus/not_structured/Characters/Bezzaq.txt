Bezzaq is a slave master from Yunkai. He is a target of Asher and Beskha. He appears in Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series. Contents[show] Biography Edit Background Edit "The Lost Lords" Edit 

Bezzaq is a slave master who was captured by Asher and Beskha in order to sell him. To Asher and Beskha's surprise, the Lost Legion enter the tavern instead of the "freed slaves" who supposedly put the bounty on Bezzaq. 

Asher and Tazal get into an argument about the payment because they should've received eight hundred dragons instead of four. In continuation, Tazal slits Bezzaq's throat and reveals that he intends to go to the Wise Masters and tell that Asher kidnapped Bezzaq and killed him because he wouldn't take less than eight hundred gold dragons and killed him, but Legion were there to enact swift justice. A fight soon escalates.
