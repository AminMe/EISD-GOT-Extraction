Aya is a child prostitute at at brothel in Braavos. It isn't clear if she is actually a career prostitute or just a servant girl working at the brothel. Meryn Trant rejects all of the other prostitutes presented to him by the brothel's madam, Season 5Edit 

The Braavosi Madam is present when Ser Meryn Trant visits the brothel she works in, seeking for a prostitute. She presents three prostitutes to him, but he claims that they are all too old. Realizing with some distaste what Trant is seeking, she presents him with a very young serving girl. Trant informs the madam that he expects a "fresh" one tomorrow night, again to her distaste. Throughout the exchange, the Madam is vexed by the presence of Lanna, a young oyster-seller, so deep in the brothel, and warns her not to show up there again.
