Marya Seaworth is the wife of Ser Davos Seaworth and mother of Matthos Seaworth. She does not appear on-screen in the TV series. Contents[show] BiographyEdit BackgroundEdit 

Davos saved up enough money through his smuggling to purchase a small plot of land. He then found a woman, Marya, kind enough to overlook his trade. Salladhor Saan attended their wedding feast. She gave him a son they named Matthos. Marya and Davos hoped that he would eventually save enough riches so he could quit smuggling. Season 2Edit 

Melisandre asks Davos if he loves his wife to which he replies he does. She asserts that he answers that way yet he has known other women and Davos tells her not to talk about his wife anymore. Melisandre says that she is speaking of other women like herself and asserts that Davos wants her. Season 3Edit 

After rescuing Davos, Salladhor Saan advises him to return to Marya so he can comfort her following their son's death, but Davos demands to be taken to Dragonstone to stop Melisandre. Salladhor agrees but jokes that, after Davos is killed, he will gather his bones so that Marya can wear them around her neck.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Marya is the daughter of a common carpenter. She has seven sons with Davos: Dale, Allard, Matthos, Marc, Devan, Stannis (named after the king), and Steffon. While Davos went with Stannis' household to Dragonstone, Marya remained at the family keep in Cape Wrath to raise their two youngest sons. Of Marya's other five sons, only Devan survived after the Battle of Blackwater. 

Marya is described as good-natured, plump woman with sagging breasts and a kindly smile.
