Lord Glenmore is the head of House Glenmore. He is mentioned in Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series. Contents[show] BiographyEdit 

Lord Glenmore commands a moderately sized army, and is described by Lady Elissa Forrester as being "no coward". His daughter, Elaena, had been betrothed to Rodrik Forrester before the War of the Five Kings broke out, the reason for the two not already being married. He is protected by the Glenmore Elite Guard, a force of twenty men, led by his son, Arthur Glenmore. "The Lost Lords"Edit 

After Elaena had received word that Rodrik survived the Red Wedding, she quickly set out for Ironrath. However, Lord Glenmore advised her to reconsider the betrothal in light of recent events. Depending on player choice, Rodrik can potentially offer half of the Forresters' ironwood to Lord Glenmore so that his worries may be assuaged. "Sons of Winter"Edit 

Elaena and her brother Arthur Glenmore visit Ironrath, on the grounds to help Rodrik take down Gryff Whitehill, because Lord Ludd Whitehill paid Lord Glenmore a visit at Rillwater Crossing and threatened him and his house with destruction along with the Forresters if he didn't accept a marriage between Gryff and Elaena. Lord Glenmore accepted the deal. He also believes his elite guard is on a ship bound for the Reach, when they are actually with Arthur and Elaena in Ironrath.
