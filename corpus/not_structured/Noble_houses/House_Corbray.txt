House Corbray is a vassal house which holds fealty to House Arryn of the Eyrie. Contents[show] HistoryEdit 

A Braavosi sellsword in service to House Corbray resettled in the Vale of Arryn. His great-grandson is Lord Petyr Baelish also known as Littlefinger. Known membersEdit Ser Vance Corbray, a knight AncestorsEdit Ser {Gwayne Corbray}, knight of the Kingsguard. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Corbrays are an old but poor house. They hold the Valyrian steel blade known as Lady Forlorn. 

The heraldry of House Corbray in the books is three black ravens in flight, each holding a separate red heart, on a white field. In the TV series continuity (as briefly glimpsed in an animated featurette), it is a single black raven rather than three.
