In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Swyft is counted as a strong vassal and ally of House Lannister. However, Tyrion Lannister considers Ser Harys to be a chinless craven and lickspittle of little worth. Dorna is described as "equally chinless" as her father. 

House Swyft&nbsp;joined their Lannister&nbsp;lieges in siding with King Aegon II Targaryen&nbsp;during the Dance of the Dragons. &nbsp;At this time they were a full noble house, but by the time the series begins they are a knightly house. How the Swyfts&nbsp;lost their lordship is unknown.​ MembersEdit Ser Harys Swyft, the Knight of Cornfield His eldest daughter, Dorna. Married to Ser Kevan Lannister. His son and heir, Ser Steffon Swyft. His daughter, Joanna Swyft. His youngest daughter, Shierle Swyft.
