Their seat is the oldest city in Westeros. They call it Oldtown. Wealthy, proud, and solitary, there have been Hightowers who wouldn't come down from their great lighthouse for decades. Its name, fittingly, the Hightower." ―Margaery Tyrell[src]

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Hightower is a powerful family with strong ties to the Tyrells. The family is very old, existing since the Dawn of Days when they were petty-kings. During the coming of the Andals and the creation of the Kingdom of the Reach, the Hightowers allied with the newcomers. Thus, they were able to keep their wealth, lands, and privileges. House Hightower rarely takes part in wars within the realm. They were integral in the foundation of the Citadel and continue to be patrons of both the Order of Maesters and the Faith of the Seven. 

House Hightower is said to be as rich as House Lannister and can field three times as many swords as other Tyrell bannermen, as they have vassals of their own, such as House Cuy; more, if they took everyone possible out of Oldtown. The four-decked Honor of Oldtown is the flagship of the Hightower&nbsp;fleet. In the War of the Five Kings, so far the Hightowers have followed the Tyrell lead, declaring for Renly Baratheon&nbsp;on the outbreak of the conflict, and not changing to Stannis Baratheon's&nbsp;side after Renly's assassination. 

The house is led by Lord Leyton Hightower. The sigil of House Hightower is a stone white watchtower, with a fire on the top. Their words are "We Light the Way".
