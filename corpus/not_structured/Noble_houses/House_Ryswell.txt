In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Ryswell is a proud and large house sworn to House Stark. They have close ties to House Bolton thanks to the marriage between Roose Bolton and the late Bethany Ryswell. The current head of the family is Lord Rodrik Ryswell, father of both Lady Barbrey and Lady Bethany. 

Their sigil is a black horse's head, eyes and mane red, on bronze within a black engrailed border. However, several Ryswells hold their own sigils, altering the color of the horse's head.
