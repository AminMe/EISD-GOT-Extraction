But after a thousand years their line was exhausted and fell to the Storm Kings, who fell to the ironborn." ―Ser Brynden Tully[src] 

House Mudd is an extinct great house that once ruled the Riverlands as Kings of the Rivers and Hills. Eventually, however, their line was seemingly extinguished after being defeated by the Storm Kings of House Durrandon. In the books Edit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Mudd was the last dynasty of First Men that ruled the Riverlands. Their seat was a castle now in ruins and called Oldstones. Under King Tristifer IV, "the Hammer of Justice", they resisted the Andal Invasion. Tristifer IV was said to have been victorious in ninety nine battles, but was defeated at his hundreth, in which seven Kings banded against him. Under his successor, King Tristifer V, House Mudd fell to the Andals. 

​Tr​istan Mudd was a Lord Commander of the&nbsp;Night's&nbsp;Watch and is remembered as one of the worst Lord Commanders the Night's Watch has ever had.&nbsp; 

In Essos there are still Westerosi exiles with the surname Mudd, but it is unknown if these are true descendants of House Mudd. See also Edit House Mudd on A Wiki of Ice and Fire (spoilers from the books) ReferencesEdit v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e Great Houses of Westeros The Crownlands:
