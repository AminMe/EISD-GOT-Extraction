House Thorne is a vassal house to House Baratheon of King's Landing. It is located within the Crownlands and holds fealty directly to the Iron Throne. MembersEdit Ser Alliser Thorne, a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, former Master-at-Arms of Castle Black, currently First Ranger. In the booksEdit 

As a vassal house sworn to King's Landing, House Thorne contributed troops to the defense of the city during the Sack of King's Landing. Ser Alliser Thorne was on the walls when the Lannister troops stormed the Red Keep. He was wounded and captured. Tywin Lannister gave him the choice between taking the black or being executed. He chose the former. 

Nothing else is known about the family save their arms - a silver flail on a red background - and the fact that they still exist. 

A historial member of the house is Ser Rickard Thorne, a knight&nbsp;of the Kingsguard who served during the reign of King Viserys I and chose to side with King Aegon II during the Dance of the Dragons.&nbsp; See alsoEdit House Thorne on A Wiki of Ice and Fire (spoilers from the books) Retrieved from "http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Thorne?oldid=229009"
