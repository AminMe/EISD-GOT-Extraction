House Reyne is an extinct vassal house of the Westerlands, formerly sworn to House Lannister of Casterly Rock. Their seat was Castamere. Contents[show] HistoryEdit BackgroundEdit 

The red lion of House Reyne. 

The red lion of Reyne confronts the golden lion of Lannister. 

For a time, House Reyne was the second wealthiest family in Westeros, behind House Lannister. They were not content with being the second wealthiest, however, and the last Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock, and gave his wife diamonds to wear which were bigger than any that Tywin Lannister's&nbsp;wife Joanna ever wore. 

Eventually, House Reyne openly challenged their liege-lords, feeling that House Lannister's rule over the Westerlands had grown weak under Tywin's ineffectual father Tytos Lannister. In response, however, the capable young Tywin Lannister marched his forces against the upstart Lord Reyne. At the end of the Reyne Rebellion, Tywin's army put Castamere castle to the torch, and had all surviving members of House Reyne put to the sword - man, woman, and child - as an example to any vassals who would dare challenge the Lannisters in the future. Tywin subsequently had the corpses of the executed Reynes hung from the gates of Casterly Rock on public display, where he left them to rot for the entire summer (it was a long summer, which lasted many years). 

The destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song "The Rains of Castamere." Season 3 Edit 

House Reyne meet their end at the hands of Tywin Lannister Cersei Lannister recounts the story of House Reyne's demise to Margaery Tyrell just prior to her brother Tyrion's wedding to Sansa Stark, in an effort to intimidate her, as Cersei perceives House Tyrell as having a hidden agenda. 

The song "The Rains of Castamere" is later performed scornfully during the Red Wedding, in which King Robb Stark's entire Northern army is slaughtered by House Bolton and House Frey in a coup devised with House Lannister. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Reynes were one of the richest and most powerful families in the Westerlands after the Lannisters. During their defiance against Casterly Rock and Lord Tytos Lannister, the Reynes rose alongside the ancient House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall. Both houses were totally annihilated by Tywin Lannister.
