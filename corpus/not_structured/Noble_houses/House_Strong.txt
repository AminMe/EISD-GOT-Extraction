House Strong heraldry from the "Histories &amp; Lore" featurettes. 

House Strong is an extinct noble house of the Riverlands. Their sigil was a tripartite pale blue, red, and green on white. 

Their seat was the castle of Harrenhal, which was granted to them after the extinction of House Harroway. However, the Strongs also died out, like all the Houses to hold Harrenhal, and the castle was passed on to House Lothston. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Strong's backstory is the same. Some descendants of the House live in exile in the Free Cities. 

House Strong held Harrenhal from the time of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen to the time of Rhaenyra and Aegon II Targaryen. 

There have been a number of historical&nbsp;Strongs&nbsp;mentioned in the books. One was Ser&nbsp;Lucamore Strong known as "Lucamore the Lusty". &nbsp;He was a knight of the Kingsguard&nbsp;during the reign of Jaehaerys I who broke the Kingsguard vows of chastity&nbsp;by secretly marrying three women and fathering sixteen children. &nbsp;His sworn brothers discovered this and informed the king, who then had Lucamore gelded and sent to the Wall to join the Night's Watch. 

Another notable Strongs were Lord Larys Strong, Lord of Harrenhal, who served as Master of Whisperers&nbsp;under King Viserys I and King Aegon II, and&nbsp;Ser Harwin Strong, lover of Rhaenyra&nbsp;Targaryen&nbsp;and rumored father of her first three children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See alsoEdit House Strong on A Wiki of Ice and Fire (spoilers from the books) v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e Houses from the Riverlands Great House:
