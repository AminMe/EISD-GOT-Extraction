House Toyne is an extinct noble House from the Stormlands. Known membersEdit {Simon Toyne}, leader of the band of outlaws known as the Kingswood Brotherhood. {Terrence Toyne}, defeated by Prince Aemon the&nbsp;Dragonknight at&nbsp;the tourney of Riverrun. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Toyne fell from grace after Ser Terrence Toyne of the Kingsguard was beheaded under orders of Aegon IV Targaryen for having an affair with one of the King's mistresses. His brothers tried to avenge his death but were stopped by Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, though the latter lost his life in the process. Afterward the brothers Toyne were also executed for treason. Some members of House Toyne went into exile across the Narrow Sea where they joined House Blackfyre in their repeated attempts to unseat House Targaryen from the Iron Throne. 

Their sigil is a winged heart, black on gold, within a black bordure embattled and their words are "Fly High, Fly Far". See alsoEdit House Toyne on A Wiki of Ice and Fire (spoilers from the books)
