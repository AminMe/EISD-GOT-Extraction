In A Song of Ice and Fire, they are a loyal vassal house to House Baratheon of Storm's End. 

Lord Bryce Caron, son of the late Bryen Caron, is a respected warrior. He has a bastard brother Ser Rolland Storm, who is called the Bastard of Nightsong. 

Bryce Caron, not Davos Seaworth, was the one who dissuaded Stannis Baratheon from taking Melisandre to the Battle of the Blackwater, claiming that people would say Stannis owed the crown to her spells. In the battle, Bryce was killed in single combat by Ser Philip Foote. His lands, titles and incomes were granted to Ser Philip by the king.
