House Smallwood is a vassal house of the Riverlands, the region formerly ruled by House Tully and now by House Baelish. Their seat is Acorn Hall. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 5Edit 

Samwell Tarly presents some paperwork to Lord Commander Jon Snow consisting of requests to various noble Houses to send new recruits to the Night's Watch. Few Houses can spare any men during the War of the Five Kings so the Watch is left scraping the bottom of the barrel: the requests are mostly to minor lords that Jon says he hasn't even heard of, including Lord Ashford, Lady Caulfield, Lord Smallwood, Lord Mayzen, and Lord Wibberley. MembersEdit Lord Theomar Smallwood, Lord of Acorn Hall In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Smallwood is a noble house sworn to House Vance of Wayfarer's Rest. Their sigil is six brown acorns, 3-2-1, on yellow and their motto is "From These Beginnings." Its known members are: Lord Theomar Smallwood, Lord of Acorn Hall. Lady Ravella Swann, his wife. Carellen Smallwood, their daughter. an unknown son who died at the age of seven. 

Members with unspecified kinship to the main branch: {Thoren Smallwood}, a ranger and senior officer of the Night's Watch. Killed by a wight-bear at the Battle of the Fist of the First Men. 

An historical member of the house, Myles Smallwood, was a Hand of the King&nbsp;​who was renowned for his courage. &nbsp;He was a disaster as the Hand and now a warning to those who become Hands. 

During the War of the Five Kings House Smallwood follows their liege lord against House Lannister, while Lady Ravella sends Carellen to her great-aunt at a motherhouse in Oldtown. Acorn Hall, in the meantime, serves as safe haven for the Brotherhood Without Banners. Smallwood men are present at the camps outside the Twins prior to the Red Wedding. Lord Theomar bends the knee to the Iron Throne following the massacre.
