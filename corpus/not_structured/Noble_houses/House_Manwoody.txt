A House Manwoody banner is seen amongst the delegation of Dornish lords who accompany Prince Oberyn Martell to King's Landing. Podrick identifies their banner by name. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Manwoody's castle seat guards the western of the two passes that lead through the Red Mountains into Dorne, known as the Prince's Pass. While House Fowler's seat at Skyreach is further south near the top of the pass, Kingsgrave is located further north, about halfway through the mountains. As a result, the Manwoodys are marcher lords, always the first line of defense in the frequent border wars which occurred in the Dornish marches between Dorne, the Stormlands, and the Reach. The name "Kingsgrave" as well as the Manwoody sigil - a crowned skull - refer to the fact that an old King of the Reach was slain in battle there centuries ago. 

As they are located deep within the Red Mountains, the Manwoodys are presumably "Stony Dornishmen" - those with the least Rhoynar bloodlines. Instead, the Stony Dornishmen are primarily composed of the same First Men/Andal ethnic mixture as the rest of southern Westeros. As a result, Stony Dornishmen tend to be tall and light-haired. 

The members of House Manwoody at the time of the novels are: Lord Dagos Manwoody: Lord of Kingsgrave. Mors Manwoody, his eldest son. Dickon Manwoody, his second son. Ser Myles Manwoody, his brother.
