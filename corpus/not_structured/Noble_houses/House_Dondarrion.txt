House Dondarrion sigil, from the Season 3 Histories &amp; Lore. "For thousands of years the Storm Kings fought the Gardener kings of the Reach and various families of Dorne... for control of the Dornish Marches, just below the Red Mountains. The fighting didn't stop until Dorne married into the Seven Kingdoms, a mere hundred years ago. But still the houses of the Stormlands, such as the Dondarrions, guard the Boneway, the mountain pass into the Marches, against any Dornish incursion." ―Brienne of Tarth[src] 

House Dondarrion is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Baratheon of Storm's End. Their lands are located within the Dornish Marches, a region of the Stormlands that lies to the north of Dorne. Their castle is called Blackhaven and the head of the house is the Lord of Blackhaven. 

House Dondarrion is ruled by Lord Beric Dondarrion, a charismatic and popular young lord, noted for his skill at tourneys. House Dondarrion's sigil is a forked purple lightning bolt on a black sky speckled with four-pointed stars. MembersEdit Lord Beric Dondarrion, the ruling lord of the house. Sent to the Riverlands by Ned Stark to bring the king's justice to Ser Gregor Clegane. Now the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Dondarrion was founded by a messenger who brought word of an impending attack by Dorne to the Storm King. The messenger was attacked by two Dornishmen, but a freak bolt of lightning killed both of them, allowing the messenger to complete his task. 

A century before the events of the series, House Dondarrion was charged by the King to root out a bandit warlord known as the Vulture King, who had established a hideaway in the Red Mountains. The Dondarrions, allied to the neighboring House Caron of Nightsong, took eight hundred horse and four thousand foot soldiers into the mountains to complete the mission. Ser Duncan the Tall took part in this mission as a small boy and squire to Ser Arlan of Pennytree. 

Lord Beric Dondarrion is young, handsome and popular, known for his valor, steadfastness and reliability. See alsoEdit House Dondarrion on A Wiki of Ice and Fire (MAJOR spoilers from the books) v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e Houses from the Stormlands Great House:
