Forgive me, I do not know this name." Talisa Maegyr: "An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis." — Talisa Maegyr being introduced by Robb Stark to his mother.[src] 

Maegyr is an old family name in Volantis. 

"Maegyr" is pronounced "My-gear". Contents[show] MembersEdit Queen Talisa Maegyr Stark, wife of King Robb Stark. Her father Her mother Her younger brother Behind the scenesEdit 

During rewrites, Robb Stark's romantic interest began&nbsp;to get an&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;different backstory than in the novels. George R.R. Martin himself suggested the name Maegyr as an old Volantene name to accommodate the changes from his source novels.&nbsp;Talisa's backstory does not include how, or even if, she is related to the same Maegyr family written about in the novels. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Malaquo Maegyr is one of the Triarchs of Volantis, the city's three rulers. Triarchs like Malaquo Maegyr are elected from amongst those noble families who can prove unbroken descent from old Valyria. Malaquo Maegyr is a "Tiger," from the "Old Bloods" political faction who favor more resource allocation into preparing for war. Fittingly, the sigil next to the onscreen credit for Oona Chaplin&nbsp;in the opening titles, who portrays Talisa Maegyr, is two tigers circling one another. Nevertheless, Volantene families do not employ sigils, which is a Westerosi custom.
