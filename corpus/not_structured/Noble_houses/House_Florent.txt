House Florent is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Tyrell of Highgarden. Their seat is Brightwater Keep. The head of the house holds the title of Lord of Brightwater Keep. The Florent sigil is a red gold fox's head on an ermine background. 

House Florent had close ties to House Gardener when they were the Kings of the Reach prior to the Wars of Conquest. House Tyrell were installed as Wardens of the South after King Mern Gardener was killed fighting Aegon the Conqueror. House Florent resents the elevation of House Tyrell and believe they have a more valid claim to the position. They are fighting for Stannis Baratheon in the War of the Five Kings. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 1Edit 

The Florent sigil is present in the Tourney of the Hand. Season 2Edit 

House Florent follows their liege lords, House Tyrell, in pledging support to Renly Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne. Following the death of Renly, however, the Florents do not follow their Tyrell overlords and instead go over to Stannis, as Selyse Florent is the wife of Stannis. They participate in the Battle of the Blackwater. Season 3Edit

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Florents, like the Tyrells, claim descent from the extinct House Gardener, the royal line of the defunct Kings of the Reach. The Florents are known to chafe at the fealty owed to House Tyrell. The Florents believe that they have a superior line of descent, and by rights should possess Highgarden. While many Houses in the Reach can claim some descent from House Gardener, the Florents were a cadet branch of the Gardeners (descended from a younger son), while the Tyrells can only claim descent from the Gardeners through the female line. Physically, Florents are known for having large and prominent ears. 

The Heraldry of House Florent in the books is inconsistently described, but apparently consists of a red-gold fox's head, encircled by lapis lazuli flowers, all of which is on an ermine background. The TV version simply omits the lapis lazuli flowers (and predominantly shows a full-bodied fox). 

During the War of the Five Kings, the Florents initially declare for Renly Baratheon along with the rest of the noble Houses in the Reach, but following the latter's assassination, they defy the Tyrells and join Stannis Baratheon, becoming one of the few Houses of the Reach not to join their Tyrell overlords in switching their allegiance to House Lannister.
