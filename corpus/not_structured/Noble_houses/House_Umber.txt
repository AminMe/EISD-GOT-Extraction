House Umber of the Last Hearth is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Stark of Winterfell. Their lands are in the far north of the Stark territories, just south of the Wall and the lands held by the Night's Watch. Their stronghold is a castle called Last Hearth and the head of the house is the Lord of Last Hearth. 

House Umber's sigil is four chains linked by a central ring. Their motto is not known at present. Contents[show] MembersEdit

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Umbers are staunch supporters of the Starks, but truly respect strength alone. The Umbers are strong, formidable warriors who enjoy life to the full, although some of the family members are less reputable, with some Umber lords said to still practice the banned tradition of First Night. Their lands are close to the Wall and they are bitterly opposed to the Wildlings, as sometimes small wildling bands who evade the Watch raid their lands. 

The Umbers are the northernmost noble House in Westeros, and may be named after the real English county of Northumberland or the medieval Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. 

House Umber's Heraldry in the books is different to the TV show. In the books, the sigil is a roaring giant in chains, but in the TV show it is just the chains.
