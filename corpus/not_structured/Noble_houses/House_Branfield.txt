But his loyalty to the Targaryens cost us dearly. I watched as countless of our kin fell, saw our lands destroyed, everything we clung to was ripped from our hands." ―Elissa Branfield explains the fate of her house.[src] 

House Branfield is a minor noble house from the south of Westeros. They were noted Targaryen loyalists. After the fall of House Targaryen, House Branfield lost all its lands and titles, with most of its members killed or exiled. Today, only one known member of House Branfield is still alive, Malcolm Branfield. Contents[show] HistoryEdit BackgroundEdit 

House Branfield is a minor southern house. They fought for House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion, after which all of their lands and titles were taken from them. Elissa Branfield had married Gregor Forrester, heir to House Forrester of Ironrath, some time before the rebellion. She was torn between the loyalty of both houses, despite being married to Lord Gregor but ultimately chose House Forrester. Elissa's brother, Malcolm fought bravely along with his brothers during the war, but never married or fathered any children, ensuring the eventual extinction of the house. Since Elissa's daughter Mira is a lady in waiting to Margery Tyrell, it is possible that House Branfield was originally from The Reach (especially as the Tyrells were Targaryen supporters during Robert's Rebellion).  ​"Iron From Ice"Edit 

House Branfield ​is not mentioned in Iron From Ice but their name can be first seen in the codex page.&nbsp; ​"The Lost Lords"Edit 

Lady Elissa reminisces about how her father's house was once a mighty house like House Forrester, but their loyalty to House Targaryen cost them dearly, which resulted in most of the house being killed.
