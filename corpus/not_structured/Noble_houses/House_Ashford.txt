House Ashford is a vassal house from the Reach that holds fealty to House Tyrell. Its seat is Ashford castle. Their seat is Ashford. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 5Edit 

Samwell Tarly presents some paperwork to Lord Commander Jon Snow consisting of requests to various noble Houses to send new recruits to the Night's Watch. Few Houses can spare any men during the War of the Five Kings so the Watch is left scraping the bottom of the barrel: the requests are mostly to minor lords that Jon says he hasn't even heard of, including Lord Ashford, Lady Caulfield, Lord Smallwood, Lord Mayzen, and Lord Wibberley. In the booksEdit 

The Tourney of Ashford, hosted by House Ashford in 209 AL, 90 years before the A Song of Ice and Fire novels begin, is where Ser Duncan the Tall first met young Aegon V Targaryen (known as "Egg"), beginning the Tales of Dunk and Egg.
