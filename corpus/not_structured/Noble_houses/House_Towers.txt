House Towers is an extinct noble house of the Riverlands. Their sigil was five black towers on white, surrounded by a double tressure red and black. 

Their seat was the castle of Harrenhal, which was granted to them after the extinction of House Qoherys. However, the Towers also died out, and the castle was passed on to House Harroway. In the booksEdit
