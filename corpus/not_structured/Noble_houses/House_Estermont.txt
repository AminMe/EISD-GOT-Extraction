House Estermont is a vassal house from the Stormlands that holds fealty to House Baratheon. Their seat is Greenstone, a castle located on the island of Estermont in Shipbreaker Bay. Their sigil is a dark green sea turtle on a field of pale green. Contents[show] Known MembersEdit Lady {Cassana Estermont}, wife of Lord Steffon Baratheon of Storm's End and mother of Robert, Stannis, and Renly Baratheon. HistoryEdit Season 2Edit 

During the War of the Five Kings, House Estermont, along with most noble houses of the Stormlands, pledges support to Renly Baratheon's claim to the Iron Throne. Following the death of Renly, the Estermonts go over to Stannis and participate in the Battle of the Blackwater. Season 5Edit 

While sailing south from King's Landing to Dorne, Jaime Lannister asks the ship's captain if the island on the horizon is Estermont; he is corrected that it is actually Tarth. Behind the scenesEdit 

George R.R. Martin uses a turtle as his personal sigil, having kept turtles as pets when he was a child. 

In the audio commentary track for "Fire and Blood", D.B. Weiss revealed that they cut the flag for House Estermont because "we cut the turtle out, we didn't want to see a turtle." In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lady Cassana had many siblings including two brothers. The elder, Lord Eldon Estermont, is about 70 years old and head of House Estermont, and the younger, Ser Lomas Estermont, has a son, Ser Andrew. Ser Andrew Estermont had previously been Lord Stannis Baratheon’s squire for numerous years. 

The first time Queen Cersei Lannister became aware of her husband's infidelity was when they repaid a visit to the Estermonts. Queen Cersei was miserable the entire fortnight they spent with the Estermonts while King Robert enjoyed hunting, hawking, drinking, and play fighting with his maternal uncles and male cousins. He also took to reconnecting and comforting a female cousin whose father and husband died in the siege of Storm's End and eventually spent the night with her. That same night Ser Jaime Lannister offers to kill King Robert, but Queen Cersei says she wants him "horned" instead. She likes to think that was the night when her son Joffrey was conceived. 

Following the Battle of Blackwater Bay, Lord Eldon bends the knee to King Joffrey, though some members of House Estermont remain loyal to Lord Stannis.
