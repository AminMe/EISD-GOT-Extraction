House Reed of Greywater Watch is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Stark of Winterfell. House Reed is&nbsp;the southern-most house of the North. They control the vast area of swampland and bog stretching across the narrowest part of the continent of Westeros, the Neck. The Reeds and their vassals are Crannogmen, a distinct off-shoot of the First Men who have adapted to living in the swamps of the Neck. 

House Reed's heraldry is a black lizard-lion on a grey-green field. &nbsp; Contents[show] MembersEdit Lord Howland Reed, Lord of Greywater Watch and the head of the family.

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the crannogmen of the Neck are gifted and talented hunters and warriors. They have an ages-old feud with House Frey, who rule the lands immediately to the south. The Reeds came to the attention of their liege lords, House Stark, when Howland Reed met Eddard Stark at a tournament at Harrenhal. Howland Reed and Eddard Stark became fast friends and allies. Aside from Eddard, Howland was the only survivor of the raid at the Tower of Joy, on the occasion of Lyanna Stark's death. The Reed stronghold at Greywater Watch is hard to find because it supposedly moves around on a floating island.
