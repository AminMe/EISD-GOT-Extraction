House Dustin of Barrowton is a vassal house that holds fealty to House Stark of Winterfell. They control Barrowton, a settlement in the Barrowlands, north of Blazewater Bay. 

The only known member of House Dustin is the Lady of the house, Barbrey Ryswell. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 2Edit 

While posing as a cupbearer to Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal, Arya Stark claims to be from Maidenpool, the seat of House Mooton. However, Arya is not able to identify House Mooton's sigil to Tywin. She admits to being from the North instead, claiming to be a stonemason's daughter from Barrowton. She describes House Dustin's sigil perfectly, convincing Tywin. 

Tywin later criticizes Arya's pronunciation of "My lord." He says that she sounds high born but Arya counters that her mother served as a handmaid to Lady Dustin for many years and taught her how to speak properly. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Dustin are the rulers of Barrowton. They have a vassal house of their own, House Stout of Goldgrass. House Dustin is ruled by Lady Barbrey Dustin, widow of Willam Dustin, who died at the end of Robert's Rebellion, killed by the Mad King's surviving Kingsguard at the Mountains of Dorne. 

Brandon Stark was fostered during his youth at Barrowton by House Dustin and Barbrey Ryswell was besotted by him. She hoped to marry him, but this was dashed when he was betrothed to Catelyn Tully. Barbrey instead was left to marry Lord William Dustin, whose lands are on the eastern border of House Ryswell's. Following William's death at the end of the rebellion, it isn't clear if he had any heirs, as Lady Barbrey appears to rule Barrowton in his name. As a result, Lady Barbrey leads House Dustin to closely follow neighboring House Ryswell in political decisions, as its current lord,&nbsp;Rodrik, is her own father. 

Lady Dustin holds a grudge against Eddard Stark for not bringing her husband's bones north with him so she could bury him at his ancestral home.
