House Musgood is a vassal house from the Stormlands that holds fealty to House Baratheon. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 4Edit 

Davos Seaworth reports to Stannis Baratheon he has managed to secure the support of some noble houses, among them being House Musgood. Stannis derisively retorts that they do not have enough men to raid a pantry. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Musgood has only been mentioned. Jack Musgood was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch during the invasion of Raymun Redbeard, King Beyond the Wall. He didn't notice Raymun's invasion and was known after that as Sleepy Jack. Their sigil is a golden pavillion on blue and a green laurel crown on white, quartered.
