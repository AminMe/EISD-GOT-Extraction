House Yronwood​ is a noble house from Dorne in Westeros, that holds fealty to House Martell of Sunspear. Their seat is Yronwood. 

"Yronwood" is pronounced "iron wood", being simply spelled with a "Y" instead of an "I". Contents[show] HistoryEdit BackgroundEdit Known membersEdit {Edgar Yronwood}, a former Lord of Yronwood. ​In the booksEdit 

​In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Yronwood of Yronwood is the most powerful house in Dorne after the Martells. Yronwood Castle is the last fortress defending the Boneway: this is reflected in their title Warden of the Stone Way. The Yronwoods were kings in Dorne before the arrival of the Rhoynar, and the head of the house continues to hold the self-styled title "The Bloodroyal". 

Located in the Red Mountains along Dorne's western border, the Yronwoods are Stony Dornishmen - with hardly any Rhoynar ancestry, and mostly resembling the First Men/Andals like the rest of the Seven Kingdoms. 

The Yronwoods have been the Martells' main rivals in Dorne since they arrived, and only grudgingly submitted to their rule after they were defeated. During major civil wars in Westeros, the Yronwoods have frequently used the opportunity to choose the opposite side from the Martells, such as during the Blackfyre Rebellion. King Daeron II Targaryen intermarried with the Martells to finally unite Dorne with the rest of the realm, leading to a pro-Martell/pro-Dorne faction developing at his court, while an anti-Dorne faction rallied around Daemon Blackfyre, which later erupted into civil war. Even so, House Yronwood sided with the Blackfyres against the rest of Dorne and the Martells. ​See alsoEdit ​ House Yronwood on A Wiki of Ice and Fire (spoilers from the books) ReferencesEdit ↑ Poisons (Histories &amp; Lore) Retrieved from "http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Yronwood?oldid=222374"
