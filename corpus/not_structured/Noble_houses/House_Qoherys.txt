House Qoherys is an extinct noble house of the Riverlands. Their sigil was a flaming saltire, red and yellow, between 4 white skulls, on black. 

Their seat was the castle of Harrenhal, which was granted to them by Aegon the Conqueror as a reward for their service in the War of Conquest. However, the Qoherys eventually became extinct, and the castle was passed on to House Towers. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Qoherys' backstory is the same. They were battle-companions of Aegon the Conqueror, and like House Targaryen they were of Valyrian descent. 

The founder of House Qoherys was the castellan of Dragonstone. Their line did not last long: soon after Aegon the Conqueror's death, less than forty years later, the founder's grandson was killed in a rebellion, and all of the castle's inhabitants were put to the sword, rendering House Qoherys extinct. They were replaced as the rulers of Harrenhal by House Harroway.
