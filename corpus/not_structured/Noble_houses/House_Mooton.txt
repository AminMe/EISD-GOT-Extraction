To protect her identity, Arya Stark claims to be from Maidenpool while serving Tywin Lannister as a cupbearer at Harrenhal. Tywin catches her out in her lie when she cannot identify the sigil of House Mooton. Arya then claims to be from Barrowton in the North instead, and accurately identifies its rulers, House Dustin, and their sigil. Tywin is convinced. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Mooton are the rulers of Maidenpool and their motto is "Wisdom and Strength." Their current lord is William Mooton.
