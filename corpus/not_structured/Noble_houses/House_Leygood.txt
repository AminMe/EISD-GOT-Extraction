House Leygood is a vassal house from the Reach that holds fealty to House Tyrell of Highgarden. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 4Edit 

Bronn mentions to Jaime Lannister he's having an affair with the wife of a knight from House Leygood. He mentions that the knight's sigil consisted of thunderbolts. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels no member of House Leygood has been mentioned by name. House Leygood is part of the Tyrell force that participates in the Battle of the Blackwater. Due to the little mention made of them, they do not appear to be one of the more powerful families in the Reach.
