Hornwood is a castle in the North. It is the seat of the eponymous House Hornwood, a vassal house holding fealty to House Stark of Winterfell. 

Hornwood is located in forested lands southeast of Winterfell, southwest of the Dreadfort and northeast of White Harbor, near the headwaters of the Broken Branch River. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Hornwood and its lands are located between the Manderlys of White Harbor and the Boltons of the Dreadfort and have been contested between the two in the past. The Hornwoods maintain their independence from both due to their loyalty to the Starks.
