Saltcliffe is one of the seven Iron Islands, an archipelago located on Ironman's Bay, on the western side of Westeros. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 3Edit 

As one of Ramsay Snow's sadistic torments of the captive Theon Greyjoy, before Theon knew his real identity, he pretended to be a spy sent by his sister Yara to help him escape. When Theon asked who he was, he claimed he was an ironborn from Saltcliffe. In the books Edit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Saltcliffe is the least noteworthy of any of the seven Iron Islands, without much of a distinguishing economy, culture, or history. 

At least two major noble Houses are located on the island: House Saltcliffe of Saltcliffe, and House Sunderly of Saltcliffe. Balon Greyjoy's mother was a Sunderly - grandmother of Theon and Yara.
