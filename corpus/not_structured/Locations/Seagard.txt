Seagard is a castle in the Riverlands. It is the seat of House Mallister, a vassal house holding fealty to House Tully of Riverrun. The castle is located north of Riverrun, on the coast of Ironman's Bay. It lies between the Red Fork and the Blue Fork of the Trident. Seagard was built as a defense against marauders from the Iron Islands. Contents[show] HistoryEdit 

During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Seagard was attacked by an ironborn fleet led by Rodrik Greyjoy, Lord Balon's eldest son and heir. Lord Jason Mallister slew him in combat and threw the ironborn back into the sea. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Seagard is the largest and indeed only port of note on the west coast of the Riverlands, consisting of a castle, town and port. House Mallister maintains a small fleet of half a dozen war longships and two war galleys at Seagard. 

House Mallister is a loyal vassal of House Tully, and fought underneath their banner during Robert's Rebellion. Lord Jason Mallister is noted as one of the most stalwart, reliable and honorable of the river lords. When Hoster Tully declared for King Robb Stark during the War of the Five Kings, Lord Jason also supported that move and threw his loyalty behind Robb.
