A map showing the location of the Rills on the continent of Westeros. 

The Rills are a region along the west coast of the North, west of the Barrowlands and southwest of Winterfell. The Stony Shore forms the coast of the region, while the Wolfswood and Sea Dragon Point are located to the north. Blazewater Bay is to the south. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Rills are a region of hills, lakes and rivers south-west of Torrhen's Square and north-west of Barrowton. House Ryswell holds the Rills for the Starks of Winterfell. 

The Ryswells are noted for their honor. According to legend, a previous lord of the Rills arrested his own son for deserting the Night's Watch, returning him to the Wall for trial and execution. The same lord later took the black himself to help amend for his son's treachery.
