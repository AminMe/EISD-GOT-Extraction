The winter town is a settlement in the North, located just outside of Winterfell itself. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 1Edit 

Tyrion Lannister sneaks off from the main royal caravan of King Robert Baratheon, which was headed to Winterfell itself, to visit the local brothel in the winter town, where he has sex with the prostitute named Ros. Jaime Lannister arrives to fetch him back to come to the feast the Starks are holding at Winterfell later that night. Season 2Edit 

Bran Stark gives two orphans of the winter town, Jack and Billy, to a shepherd asking for asistance in defending his flock from wolves. The two orphans are later killed by Theon Greyjoy and his men to cover the escape of Bran and Rickon Stark. Season 3Edit 

Ros explains to Shae that she grew up in the winter town just outside of Winterfell itself. Season 5Edit 

Brienne and Podrick Payne take a room at an inn at the winter town as she begins to plan for a way to extract Sansa Stark from Winterfell, which is occupied by House Bolton. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire the winter town is formed by rows of small and neat houses built of log and undressed stone. Located at Winterfell's main gatehouse, the market square has wooden stalls for produce and goods and a well at its center. The local alehouse is the Smoking Log. The Kingsroad lies past the sprawl of castle and town, while the Wolfswood is two miles away. Hunting parties from Winterfell can avoid the winter town by taking the Hunter's Gate instead of the main gate. 

Its streets are muddy during summer, when four fifths of the homes are left empty. During wintertime, however, the winter town becomes filled with northmen from throughout the region, such as clansmen from the northern mountains. Some townfolk claim that Winterfell is warmed by a dragon which sleeps below the castle - really the castle was built over a series of natural hot springs. 

In the novels, the Winter town is burned by the men of House Bolton when they betray the Northmen led by Ser Rodrik Cassel during the attempt to liberate Winterfell from the House Greyjoy occupation led by Theon Greyjoy, as part of the Sack of Winterfell.
