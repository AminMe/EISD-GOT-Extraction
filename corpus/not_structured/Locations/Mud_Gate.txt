The Mud Gate is a gate in the walls of King's Landing that opens near the shore of Blackwater Bay. 

Tyrion Lannister predicts that it will be the focal point of King Stannis Baratheon's attack because it is weak and easy to land near. 

It is where the Battle of the Blackwater takes place, as Stannis and his forces attempt to take King's Landing through the gate, but are repelled by the city's defenders led by Tyrion and reinforcements from the Lannisters and the Tyrells. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the official name of this gate is actually the "River Gate", but it is commonly known as the "Mud Gate". See alsoEdit River Gate on A Wiki of Ice and Fire&nbsp;(spoilers from the books) v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e The Crownlands Regional Capital:
