The Arsenal is an island citadel guarding the sea entrance to the Free City of Braavos. It is located at the entrance to the lagoon, just beyond the Titan. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels the Arsenal sits upon a knob of rock, fortified with stone battlements and bristling with scorpions, trebuchets, and spitfires. The Arsenal is also a dock with room for dozens of galleys. It houses the defense fleet of the city and is the center of shipbuilding in Braavos. It is said that a war galley can be built in a day there. See alsoEdit Arsenal of Braavos on A Wiki of Ice and Fire v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e Braavos Institutions
