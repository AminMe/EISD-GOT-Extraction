Map showing the location of Deepwood Motte on the continent of Westeros. 

Deepwood Motte is the stronghold of House Glover, a vassal house holding fealty to House Stark of Winterfell. The castle is located north-west of Winterfell in the Wolfswood, near the coast of the Bay of Ice. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 2Edit 

Having declared himself King, Balon Greyjoy sends his daughter Yara with a fleet of thirty ships with orders to seize Deepwood Motte. Yara replies that she always wanted a castle of her own. 

Later, Yara visits Winterfell, having successfully captured the castle of Deepwood Motte. She points out to Theon that her castle lies close to the sea and can be easily taken and reinforced at will, while Winterfell is too far inland to be held indefinitely. She urges him to abandon the castle and return to Deepwood Motte with her before heading home, but he rejects her advice. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Deepwood Motte is a motte-and-bailey wooden castle rather than a more formidable stone construction. In past centuries, the castle and the surrounding area were prey to long-ranging raids by the ironborn, but it has been some considerable time since this was the case. The castle is not located on the coast due to the muddy tidal flats along the coast. Instead it is built on a hill which commands the surrounding area. 

Deepwood Motte is located approximately three hundred miles from Winterfell. 

As in the television series, the castle is seized by the Ironborn. In A Dance with Dragons, Stannis Baratheon attacks Deepwood Motte on Jon Snow's advice and liberates the castle from the ironborn during his campaign to retake Winterfell from the Boltons, winning him House Glover's alliance.
