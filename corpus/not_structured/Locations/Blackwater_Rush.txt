The Blackwater Rush, also called the Blackwater or River Blackwater, is a significant river of Westeros. It flows out of the hills and valleys of the Westerlands and proceeds eastwards for several hundred miles before flowing into Blackwater Bay. The city of King's Landing overlooks the mouth of the Blackwater. A tributary of the Blackwater feeds the lake of Gods Eye to the north. 

The town of Stoney Sept is located not far from its headwaters. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Blackwater forms the boundary between the Crownlands, Westerlands, Reach and Riverlands. King's Landing, the capital city of the Seven Kingdoms, is built on the mouth of the Blackwater where it enters Blackwater Bay.
