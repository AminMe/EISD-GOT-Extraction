A map showing the location of Flint's Finger on the continent of Westeros. 

Flint's Finger is a castle in the North. Flint's Finger is south-west of Winterfell, and lies between the Neck and Cape Kraken on the southern edge of Blazewater Bay. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Flint's Finger is the stronghold of one of the two cadet branches of Clan Flint, also known as the First Flints. The other branch is based at Widow's Watch on the opposite coast of the North, and is arguably more powerful. Flint's Finger is noted for being built over towering cliffs, which the young Balon Greyjoy once scaled during a raid.
