The Hall of a Thousand Thrones is the seat of government in Qarth and the meeting place of The Thirteen. Contents[show] History Edit Season 2 Edit 

Daenerys Targaryen, accompanied by Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Kovarro, meets with the Thirteen here after her dragons are stolen, convinced that a member of the council perpetrated the deed. In the books Edit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Hall of a Thousand Thrones is the seat of power of the Pureborn, the oligarch rulers of Qarth. Gaining access to the Hall and an audience with the Pureborn is a complicated process: To be allowed entrance, petitioners must make the traditional sacrifice in the Temple of Memory, offer the traditional bribe to the Keeper of the Long List, and send the traditional persimmon to the Opener of the Door. Finally, the petitioner will receive the traditional blue silk slippers summoning him or her to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones. 

Inside, the Pureborn sit on great wooden chairs of their ancestors, which rise in curved tiers from a marble floor to a high domed ceiling. The chairs are immense, fantastically carved, bright with gold work, and studded with amber, onyx, lapis and jade. Each one is different from all the others, and each one strives to be the most fabulous. The domed ceiling is painted with scenes of Qarth's vanquished glory.
