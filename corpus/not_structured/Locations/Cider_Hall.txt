A map showing the location of Cider Hall on the continent of Westeros. 

Cider Hall is a castle in the Reach, the region controlled by House Tyrell of Highgarden. The castle is located at the meeting of the Mander and Cockleswhent. It is the seat of House Fossoway. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Cider Hall is the seat of the red apple branch of House Fossoway. 

House Fossoway split into two houses during a great tourney at Ashford in 209 AL, when Ser Steffon Fossoway took the side of Aerion Targaryen against Ser Duncan the Tall in a trial of seven. Steffon had previously promised to support Duncan and then betrayed him. Furious at this dishonorable action, his squire and cousin Raymun volunteered to take the side of Ser Duncan. Ser Lyonel Baratheon knighted Raymun. During the resulting melee, Ser Raymun bested Ser Steffon in combat. To avoid confusion on the battlefield, Ser Raymun took a green apple as his sign. 

For later services, the green apple Fossoways descended from Ser Raymun became lords in their own right, establishing a keep and lands at New Barrel.
