A map showing the location of Vaith on the continent of Westeros. 

Vaith is a castle in Dorne, the region controlled by House Martell of Sunspear. The castle is located in the center of Dorne, near the headwaters of the Vaith river. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Vaith is the seat of House Vaith. Almost ninety years before the events of the series, Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg visited Vaith and offended Lady Vaith by unknown means. Lady Vaith almost had them killed for insolence, but relented and they were able to go free. According to Egg, Lady Vaith was insane but it is unclear if this was a realistic assessment of her character.
