A map showing the location of the Brimstone on the continent of Westeros. 

The Brimstone is a river in southern Dorne. It runs through the desert and empties into the Summer Sea. The castle of Hellholt is located on its banks. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Brimstone appears to have its source directly in the desert of southern Dorne, which seems to be unlikely. The source of the river may originate in the Red Mountains further north. Despite being the only major river in central Dorne it is of little comfort to those who must pass through the harsh desert: the waters of the river are sulphurous.
