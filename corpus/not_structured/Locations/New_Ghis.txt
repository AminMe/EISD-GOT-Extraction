A map showing the location of New Ghis off the coast of Essos. 

New Ghis is a city in the Gulf of Grief, in Essos. It is located on a small island south of Ghiscar and separated from the continent by the Ghiscari Strait. It is named after the ruined capital of the fallen Ghiscari Empire In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, New Ghis is located near the larger island of Ghaen. Much like Volantis once tried to do with the Valyrian Freehold, New Ghis seeks to rebuild the Ghiscari Empire under its leadership. 

New Ghis has a powerful army and fleet, and uses elephants in battle. Its legions draw inspiration from the Unsullied warrior-eunuchs, but while the Unsullied are slaves the troops of New Ghis are free men who serve for three-year terms.
