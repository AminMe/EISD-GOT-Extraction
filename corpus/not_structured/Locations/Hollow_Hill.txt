The Hollow Hill is a sprawling underground complex of caves and tunnels located somewhere in the Riverlands. It is adopted by the Brotherhood Without Banners, and used as their base of operations during the War of the Five Kings. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 3Edit 

Arya, Gendry, and Sandor Clegane are taken to the Hollow Hill, following the latter's capture by the Brotherhood Without Banners. There, the trio are introduced to the Brotherhood's commander: Lord Beric Dondarrion, who sentences Clegane to trial by combat. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Hollow Hill also serves as the headquarters of the Brotherhood Without Banners. For this reason, some members of the Brotherhood refer to themselves as "the Knights of Hollow Hill."
