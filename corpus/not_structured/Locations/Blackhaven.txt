A map showing the location of Blackhaven on the continent of Westeros. 

Blackhaven is a castle in the Dornish Marches, in the southwestern Stormlands. It is the seat of House Dondarrion, a vassal house holding fealty to House Baratheon of Storm's End. The castle is located south-west of Storm's End near the border with Dorne. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Blackhaven is a stout keep that has a long history as a defensive fortification against attacks out of Dorne to the south. According to legend, the castle was granted by the Storm King to a loyal scout who avoided Dornish patrols to bring him warning of an impending attack. At one point the scout was ambushed, but his attackers were killed in a freak lightning strike. As a result, the scout, who was the founder of House Dondarrion, adopted a lightning bolt as his symbol. 

Blackhaven is the home of Lord Beric Dondarrion. See alsoEdit Blackhaven on A Wiki of Ice and Fire (spoilers from the books) ReferencesEdit ↑ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Storm's End entry v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e The Stormlands Regional Capital:
