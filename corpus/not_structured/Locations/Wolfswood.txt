A map showing the location of the Wolfswood on the continent of Westeros. 

The Wolfswood is a forest in the North. It is located just north of Winterfell and extends for some three hundred miles north and west to the Bay of Ice. Deepwood Motte is located north-west of Winterfell on the other side of the Wolfswood, close to the Bay of Ice. 

The area is controlled most by House Glover of Deepwood Motte, with their vassals such as House Forrester populating it. 

Along the northwestern edge of the Wolfswood lies the largest ironwood forest in Westeros.

Bran Stark is attacked by wildlings (one of them being Osha) in the Wolfswood, before being rescued by Robb and Theon. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Wolfswood is so-named for the numerous wolves that live within its eaves. The forest is settled by crofters, foresters and hunters. House Glover of Deepwood Motte controls much of the territory of the Wolfswood. Sub-vassals of the Glovers who also live in the Wolfswood include House Forrester, House Woods, House Branch, and House Bole. Despite these woodsmen, overall the forest is thinly populated, wild and untamed.
