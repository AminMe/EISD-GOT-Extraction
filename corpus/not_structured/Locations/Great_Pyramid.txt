"They say a thousand slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen." ―Missandei[src] 

The Great Pyramid is a massive structure in the city of Meereen. It is the largest building in the city and it is said a thousand slaves died during its construction. At its apex lies a huge bronze harpy. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 4Edit 

During the Siege of Meereen, as the local slave population rises in arms against the Great Masters, an enormous black banner with the three-headed red dragon of House Targaryen is placed over the harpy atop the pyramid. After the revolt is victorious and the city falls to Daenerys Targaryen, she takes up residence in the Great Pyramid. Season 5Edit 

Some time later, the great bronze harpy atop the Pyramid is removed by Unsullied soldiers, sliding down a wooden ramp on the side of the building and crashing to the ground, heavily damaged. Interior of the Great Pyramid, where Daenerys holds court in Meereen

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Great Pyramid had been built as an echo of the Great Pyramid of Ghis, whose colossal ruins had once been visited by noted explorer Lomas Longstrider. Like its ancient predecessor, the Pyramid has thirty three levels, a number chosen intentionally, since it is considered sacred to the gods of the Ghiscari religion.
