Thoros, a Red Priest from Myr 

Myr is one of the Free Cities located to the east of Westeros. A major seaport, the city overlooks a large body of water known as the Sea of Myrth, an inlet of the Narrow Sea. The Free City of Pentos lies to the north and the Disputed Lands lie to the south. 

People and things from Myr are known as Myrish. The city's craftsmen are renowned throughout the known world, and Myrish lace is a highly sought after commodity.

While in Astapor, Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy debate whether or not Daenerys Targaryen should purchase an army of Unsullied. Selmy is opposed to having slaves for soldiers, and opts instead for hiring sellswords in Pentos and Myr. 

Varys tells Tyrion Lannister the story of his early life: as a youth he traveled with a troupe of actors through the various Free Cities. In Myr, his master sold Varys to a sorcerer who castrated him, burned his genitals as part of a spell and then kicked him out onto the street. 

While wandering in the war-torn Riverlands of Westeros, Arya Stark runs into Thoros, a Red Priest from Myr, now one of the leaders of the resistance group known as the Brotherhood Without Banners. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Myr has a reputation for great craftsmanship. The mirrors, lenses and other glassware produced in the city have no equal- a clear pane of good Myrish glass is worth its weight in spices. Myrish textiles- including intricate lace and finely woven carpets- are much sought-after products. The city even produces a signature drink- a sweet green wine known as green nectar. Myr also possesses a strong military, with its crossbowmen being particularly famed. Like most of the&nbsp;Free Cities,&nbsp;Myr is heavily involved in the slave trade, with slaves outnumbering freeborn citizens three to one.&nbsp;The city is ruled by a council of&nbsp;Magisters&nbsp;and has its own language derived from&nbsp;High Valyrian. 

The early history of Myr is something of an enigma. In its present form, the city&nbsp;was founded as a colony of the&nbsp;Valyrian Freehold, but there is evidence to suggest that human settlement in this location dates back to the&nbsp;Dawn Age. The Myrish are also noted for being dark-haired and dark-eyed with olive-colored skin,&nbsp;and are considered exotic-looking by Westerosi standards. This has led some to theorize that the Myrish may be related to the&nbsp;Rhoynar&nbsp;people- who possessed similar coloring- but this has not been conclusively proven.&nbsp; 

After the&nbsp;Doom of Valyria, Myr became independent but was conquered a few years later by Volantis, which was trying to rebuild the fallen empire. When Volantis overreached and attacked Tyrosh as well, its forces were beaten back and defeated by a coalition that included the Westerosi Storm King, troops from Pentos and Braavos as well as massive uprisings in Myr and&nbsp;Lys. Volantis's military power was broken and Myr again became an independent city-state. 

These alliances, however, soon fell apart. As a result,&nbsp;Myr and Lys&nbsp;have been perpetually warring with each other for the better part of the past three hundred years. The "Disputed Lands" between Myr to the north and Lys to the south are so-called because they are constantly changing hands between the two cities according to the outcomes of their conflicts. Tyrosh and Volantis have been drawn into this feud from time to time, allying with either Myr or Lys as the alliances shift. 

According to the Game of Thrones RPG, Myr is pronounced "Mire", and uses the adjective "Mire-ish". However, in Season 3 Thoros (of Myr) pronounces it as "Meer" (rhymes with "deer").
