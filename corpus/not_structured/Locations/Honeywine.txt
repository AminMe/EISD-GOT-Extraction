The Honeywine River flows past Oldtown in the Reach "In the far southwest of Westeros, at the mouth of the river Honeywine, lies the great stone city of Oldtown." ―Maester Luwin[src]

The Honeywine is a river in the Reach, in south-western Westeros. The Honeywine flows into the Redwyne Straits via Whispering Sound. The great city of Oldtown is located at its mouth. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Honeywine is noted as being one of the agricultural centers of the Reach. The river divides the city of Oldtown in half, with the Citadel located along its banks. The river is pleasant, with maesters and their acolytes known to frequent the inns and other establishments along its banks. Further upriver, the Honeywine flows past Honeyholt, before it finds its source in hills just north of Brightwater Keep, the seat of House Florent.
