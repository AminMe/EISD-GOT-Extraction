Pypar explains to Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly that the real reason he was sent to the Night's Watch is because he was performing as a singer at Acorn Hall when some lord touched his leg and asked to see his cock. Pyp refused, so the lord grew angry and falsely accused Pyp of attempting to steal the silverware, after which he was arrested and sent to the Night's Watch. When Sam points out that Pyp had earlier said that he was arrested for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his starving younger sister, he explains that this is just a lie he came up with because the real reason was embarrassing.
