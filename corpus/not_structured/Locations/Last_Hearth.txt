The Last Hearth is the seat of House Umber, a vassal house holding fealty to House Stark of Winterfell. It is located south of the Gift, east of the Kingsroad and north of the Last River. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 3Edit 

When&nbsp;Theon Greyjoy&nbsp;is being tortured by&nbsp;Ramsay Snow, Ramsay forces&nbsp;Theon&nbsp;to play a guessing game of their location.&nbsp;Theon&nbsp;guesses Last Hearth, but is ultimately incorrect and after another wrong guess, Ramsay flays&nbsp;Theon's&nbsp;little finger. 

​Bran Stark decides that he must go north of the Wall with Hodor, Meera and Jojen Reed&nbsp;and&nbsp;realizes that his younger brother Rickon Stark cannot go with him. To keep Rickon safe, he instructs him to leave with Osha and Shaggydog and attempt to reach the relative safety of Last Hearth.
