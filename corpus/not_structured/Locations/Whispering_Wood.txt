A map showing the location of the Whispering Wood on the continent of Westeros. 

The Whispering Wood is a forest in the Riverlands, located northwest of Riverrun along the Red Fork of the Trident. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 1Edit 

The Battle of the Whispering Wood occurred here, during which Robb Stark lured Jaime Lannister's army into a trap and annihilated it, capturing the Kingslayer himself, thus lifting Jaime's siege of Riverrun. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels the Whispering Wood is northwest of Riverrun. 

The first season HBO viewers guide showed the Whispering Wood to the north-west of Riverrun. The second season map, however, positions it east of Seagard. The initial Season 2 viewer's guide map seems to have been in error, because the HBO Viewer's Guide "Battleground Westeros" feature released later in Season 2 positioned Whispering Wood as immediately north-west of Riverrun, as in the books.
