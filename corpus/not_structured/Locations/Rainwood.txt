"The storms that blow through the bay water the Kingwood and Rainwood, two of the great forests of Westeros." ―Brienne of Tarth[src] 

The Rainwood. 

The Rainwood is a great forest in the Stormlands. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Rainwood is a large forest that lies on Cape Wrath in the Stormlands. Although it is rainy, the region is fertile enough. Mistwood is located in the southern rainwood, while Rain House is found in its northeast.
