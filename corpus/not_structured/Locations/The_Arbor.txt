Map showing the location of the Arbor off the coast of Westeros. 

The Arbor is a large island off the southwestern coast of Westeros, separated from the mainland by the Redwyne Straits. It is part of the Reach and its rulers, House Redwyne, hold fealty to House Tyrell of Highgarden. House Redwyne controls a large fleet from the Arbor. The Arbor is famous across much of the known world for its high-quality wines. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 1Edit 

The poisoned wine a wineseller in Vaes Dothrak uses to try to kill Daenerys Targaryen is said to have originated from the Arbor. Season 2Edit 

King Stannis Baratheon composes a letter revealing the truth of Cersei Lannister's incestuous relationship with her brother Jaime, that Jaime is the real father of Joffrey Baratheon, and orders that copies of the letter be sent to every corner of Westeros, "from the Arbor to the Wall". In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Arbor is the biggest shipyard in southern Westeros. Its fleet is one of the largest in the realm, behind only the King's Fleet and the Iron Fleet of the Iron Islands. The Arbor has a warm and pleasant climate, due to its position surrounded by water off Westeros's southern coast. This climate is ideal for viticulture, and the Arbor is home to vast vineyards. Locations on the Arbor include Starfish Harbor and Vinetown. 

Samwell Tarly is sent to the Arbor as a page and cupbearer where Horas and Hobber Redwyne despised him and found many different ways to shame and humiliate him. If he pleased Lord Paxter, Samwell would have been betrothed to Lord Paxter's daughter, but he is ultimately sent home to Horn Hill.
