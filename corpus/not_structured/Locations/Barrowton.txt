While serving Tywin Lannister as a cupbearer at Harrenhal, Arya Stark claims to be from Maidenpool in the Riverlands. Tywin catches her out in the lie when she cannot identify House Mooton's sigil and demands the truth. She claims instead to be a stonemason's daughter from Barrowton, and accurately describes House Dustin's sigil, convincing Tywin. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Barrowton is a town and the seat of House Dustin, which rules it from their castle of Barrow Hall. The town lies in the shadow of a large hill called the Great Barrow, held in mythology to be a site sacred to the Children of the Forest.
