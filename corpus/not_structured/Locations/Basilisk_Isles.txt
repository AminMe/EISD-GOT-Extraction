The Basilisk Isles, (in the bottom-middle of the image) as they appear in the title sequence. "He will never leave you alone. If you ride to darkest Asshai his assassins will follow you. If you sail all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies will tell him. He will never abandon the hunt." ―Ser Jorah Mormont to Daenerys Targaryen[src] 

The Basilisk Isles are a large island chain off the northern coast of the continent of Sothoryos, south of Slaver's Bay and Essos. One of the few mapped portions of Sothoryos, they are in the extreme south of the mapped world known to the inhabitants of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Asshai and Yi Ti are rumored to be even further due east, but they are unmapped. The island of Naath, also part of Sothoryos, is located west of the Basilisk Isles chain.

When an assassination attempt is made on Daenerys Targaryen in Vaes Dothrak, she says she thought King Robert Baratheon would leave her alone after her brother Viserys Targaryen died. Ser Jorah Mormont then explains to her that as the last Targaryen, King Robert's agents will never stop hunting her no matter how far she flees, even if she goes to Asshai or the Basilisk Isles. In the books Edit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Basilisk Isles are the same. To the south lies Zamettar, in the Sothoryos mainland, to the east Ax Isle and to the southwest, the Isle of Toads. 

The Basilisk Isles are dangerous pirate dens even worse than the Stepstones in the Narrow Sea. They are in a perfect location to serve as bases for pirates to prey on the major shipping lanes rounding the Valyrian Peninsula, who then sell captured crews off into slavery. Life in the Basilisk Isles is nasty, brutish, and short. It is said that the mud-and-blood towns of the Basilisk Isles teem with escaped slaves, slavers, skinners, whores, hunters, "brindled men", and worse. 

The Ghiscari Empire built outposts in the Basilisk Isles over 5,000 years ago, including the city Gogossos on the Isle of Tears which was used as a transport hub for slaver raids against the mainland. The city was captured by the Valyrian Freehold in the Third Ghiscari War. The now-Valyrian slaving outposts in the Basilisk Isles survived the Doom of Valyria (which occurred about 400 years before the War of the Five Kings), but about eighty years later a terrible plague swept through the isles, completely depopulating them. Gogossos was left in ruins ever since. 

After the plague the isles were shunned for a full century, but eventually pirates began to resettle them (during the long reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen in Westeros). Ever since, various lawless pirate fiefdoms have maintained shifting control over different islands in the chain. Every generation or so they grow to be such a problem that fleets from the Free Cities will join in alliance to scour them out, killing hundreds of pirates, but new pirate dens quickly pop up again to replace them like mushrooms in the night.
