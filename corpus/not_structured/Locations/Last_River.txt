A map showing the location of the Last River on the continent of Westeros. 

The Last River is the northern-most major river of the Seven Kingdoms. It is located in the North. The river flows out of the foothills of the southern Frostfangs and eastwards through the lands of House Umber, past their main castle at Last Hearth. The river then turns southwards and empties into the Shivering Sea north-east of the Dreadfort. The lands of House Karstark lie to the north-east of the river and the lands of House Bolton to the south. The Kingsroad crosses the river on its way north to the Wall. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels the Last River is in the same location. It isn't the last river at all before the Wall (which is still several hundred miles to the north), as smaller bodies of water can be found (such as the lake at Queenscrown), but it is the last major river of any note.
