The Redfort is a castle in the south east of the Vale of Arryn, the region controlled by House Arryn. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Redfort is the seat of the eponymous House Redfort, loyal and powerful vassals of House Arryn. House Redfort, like House Royce, is noted by Catelyn Stark as being descended from the First Men. 

Domeric Bolton was fostered at the Redfort for three years, and served as a squire to Lord Horton Redfort. See alsoEdit The Redfort on A Wiki of Ice and Fire ReferencesEdit ↑ The Artisans: Jim Stanes (at 0:14) v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e The Vale Regional Capital:
