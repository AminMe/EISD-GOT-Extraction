Fairmarket is a town in the Riverlands, the region controlled by House Tully of Riverrun. The town is located besides the Blue Fork of the Trident and north of the Red Fork, southeast of Wendish Town. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 4Edit 

As Sandor Clegane and Arya Stark make their way back through the Riverlands, traveling southeast from the Twins to enter the Vale of Arrynn at the Bloody Gate, they stop at a stream and she asks where they are. Sandor replies that he thinks they are near Fairmarket. 

After the&nbsp;Battle of Castle Black,&nbsp;Maester&nbsp;Aemon&nbsp;eulogizes the dead and mentions the fifty late black brothers came to them&nbsp;"from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west." In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, while en route to the Twins, Robb Stark sends scouts to Fairmarket to see if he could cross the Blue Fork there, but they find the wooden bridge washed out. 

Three generations before the Targaryen Conquest, Harren Hoare's grandfather Harwyn Hoare conquered the Riverlands from the Stormlands. Harwyn had no fixed capital afterwards but was constantly on campaign enforcing his reign throughout this new conquests. Harwyn's son Halleck did reign from a new capital on the mainland, a modest castle tower-house at Fairmarket. Halleck's son Harren then had the great dream of building the greatest castle-seat in all of Westeros, Harrenhal - but it took decades to complete, so it is unclear if Harren continued to rule from Fairmarket or if he ruled from Harrenhal's construction site.
