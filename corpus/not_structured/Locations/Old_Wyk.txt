Old Wyk is one of the seven main Iron Islands, an archipelago located on Ironman's Bay, on the western side of Westeros. In the books Edit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Old Wyk was the first of the islands to be settled (despite being located on the far side of the archipelago from the mainland), and the ironborn still hold it to be sacred. 

It isn't as large or wealthy as Great Wyk, Harlaw, Orkmont, or Pyke, but its "holy" status still gives it high esteem among the ironborn. Its local Houses take pride in this and are fiercely devoted raiders.
