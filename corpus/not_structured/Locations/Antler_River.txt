"We're only a few days out from the Antler River. We cross a bridge the First Men built and from there we can try to find the North Grove...right, Sylvi?" ―Cotter[src] 

The Antler River is a river located beyond the Wall. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Antler River is formed by several arches originating in the northeast of the Haunted Forest. From there, it flows southeast into the Shivering Sea.
