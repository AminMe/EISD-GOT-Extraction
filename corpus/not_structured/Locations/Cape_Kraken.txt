A map showing the location of Cape Kraken on the continent of Westeros. 

Cape Kraken is a region in the south-west of the North. It is south-west of Moat Cailin, west of the Neck and south of Blazewater Bay. Ironman's Bay and the Iron Islands are to their south. The castle Flint's Finger is in the north-east of the region. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Cape Kraken is named for the ironborn (whose sigil is a kraken) who used to raid heavily along its coasts. Being located south of the Neck, its cultural and social ties with Winterfell are somewhat loose.
