A map showing the location of Starfall on the continent of Westeros. 

Starfall is a castle in Dorne, the region controlled by House Martell of Sunspear, and the seat of House Dayne. The castle is located in the far west of Dorne, near the border with the Reach and south of Blackmont. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Starfall is the seat of House Dayne. It is located at the mouth of the River Torentine, downriver from Blackmont and the High Hermitage, which is held by a lesser branch of the Daynes. 

Starfall is so-called because of a meteor, referred to as a "fallen star", which fell out of the sky nearby, almost two thousand years ago. The Daynes forged a sword out of the meteorite ore, called "Dawn", which is as resilient and formidable as a Valyrian steel weapon in combat.
