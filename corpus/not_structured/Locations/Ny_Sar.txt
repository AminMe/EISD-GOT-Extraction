A map showing the location of Ny Sar on the continent of Essos. 

Ny Sar is a ruined city in Essos. It was the capital of the Rhoynar before they were forced to flee to Dorne by the Valyrians. The city was destroyed by the Valyrians. It sits at the confluence of the Rhoyne and the Noyne. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Ny Sar was ruled by Princess Nymeria before the defeat of the allied Rhoynar city-states by the Valyrians. After their armies were defeated, Nymeria led an exodus of her people from all the lands of the Rhoynar, fleeing into the Summer Sea and thence to Westeros, where they landed in Dorne and allied with House Martell, helping them become the dominant power in the region.
