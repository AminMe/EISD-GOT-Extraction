A map showing the location of Yronwood on the continent of Westeros. 

Yronwood is a castle in Dorne, the region controlled by House Martell of Sunspear. The castle is located in the north-west of Dorne, near the Sea of Dorne. Contents[show] NotesEdit 

Following George R.R. Martin's spelling convention that the letter "Y" can stand for any vowel in the English language, "Yronwood" is apparently pronounced "Iron-wood". In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Yronwood is the seat of House Yronwood. It is located near the southern end of the Boneway. Prince Quentyn Martell, the oldest son, but not heir under Dornish law, of Prince Doran Martell, was fostered at Yronwood for many years.
