The Long Bridge is a great structure located in the Free City of Volantis. It is a bridge spanning the mouth of the immense Rhoyne River just before it spills into the Summer Sea. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 2Edit 

When Robb Stark refers to Talisa Maegyr as "lady," she wonders how come he believes her to a member of the nobility. It is obvious to him&nbsp;and she&nbsp;poises a&nbsp;hypothetical question about what if she was a merchant's daughter who had a shop on the Long Bridge. Robb still remains firm that she is a noblewoman and she later confirms that she is. Season 5Edit 

Upon their arrival in Volantis, Tyrion Lannister and Varys explore the Long Bridge when the former insists on being allowed out of the carriage they've ridden in since departing Pentos. They view various shops and see the severed hands of thieves on display. They duck into a brothel after a Red Priestess unnerves Tyrion with her sermon. Behind the scenesEdit 

The famous Roman bridge of Córdoba in Spain was used as a stand-in for the Long Bridge of Volantis - though the real bridge was then augmented with CGI to make it look proportionately larger and to add buildings and markets atop it, as the Long Bridge is described in the novels. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Long Bridge joins the two halves of Volantis across the mouth of the Rhoyne. It is a great span with a road supported by massive piers that the Valyrians built at the height of their glory. Its gateway is an arch of black stone carved with sphinxes, manticores, dragons, and other strange beasts. The road is just wide enough for two carts to pass abreast. Buildings rise on either side of the roadway. One can buy almost anything in the shops on the Long Bridge. In the center of the bridge the hands of thieves and the heads of executed criminals are displayed. 

The Long Bridge is one of the known world's most famous megastructures. Lomas Longstrider included it in his list of the nine Wonders Made by Man. Other wonders in this list include the Wall in Westeros, the Titan of Braavos, and the great triple walls of Qarth.
