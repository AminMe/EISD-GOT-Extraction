Stone Hedge is a castle in the Riverlands. It is the seat of House Bracken, a vassal house holding fealty to House Tully of Riverrun. The castle is located east of Riverrun, south of the Red Fork of the Trident. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 2Edit 

During the War of the Five Kings, Stone Hedge is occupied by Lannister forces. Following the lifting of the Lannister siege of Riverrun at the Battle of the Camps, Robb Stark divides his host in two, one that invades the Westerlands under his personal command, and another under the command of Greatjon Umber, which liberates Stone Hedge as well as other castles west of the Red Fork. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Stone Hedge is an important stronghold of the Riverlands. It was burned by Gregor Clegane at the outset of the War of the Five Kings. Lord Jonos Bracken later retakes the castle after Robb Stark drove the Lannister army from the area.
