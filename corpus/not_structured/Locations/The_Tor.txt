A map showing the location of the Tor on the continent of Westeros. 

The Tor is a castle in Dorne, the region of Westeros that is controlled by&nbsp;House Martell of Sunspear. The castle is located in the north of Dorne on the shore of the Sea of Dorne. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Tor is the seat of House Jordayne, one of the most powerful Dornish houses. 

In the novels, George R.R. Martin named this castle and its house as a tribute to fellow fantasy author Robert Jordan, author of the Wheel of Time series. Tor Books are the publishers of the Wheel of Time books and the head of House Jordayne is Lord Trebor (a palindrome of 'Robert').
