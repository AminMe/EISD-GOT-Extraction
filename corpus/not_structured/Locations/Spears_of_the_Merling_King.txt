The Spears of the Merling King are a geographic feature in Blackwater Bay. They are a group of rocky and barren islets and seamonts rising above the water. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 3Edit 

Following the wildfire explosion that threw him into the ocean during the Battle of the Blackwater, Davos Seaworth washes ashore to one of the spears. After having suffered from hunger, drought, and exposure for several days, he's finally rescued by Salladhor Saan's crew men. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Spears of the Merling King are named after the Merling King, a deity commonly revered by sailors. For every spear that breaks the surface a dozen more lie just beneath. For this reason, it is considered quite dangerous for any ship to sail into the Spears, as the hidden monts will rip the bottom of any passing vessel.
