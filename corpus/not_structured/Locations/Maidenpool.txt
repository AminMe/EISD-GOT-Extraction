A map showing the location of Maidenpool on the continent of Westeros. 

Maidenpool is a town in the Riverlands, the region controlled by House Tully of Riverrun. It is the seat of House Mooton. It is located at the estuary of the Trident near the border of the Crownlands. It is located to the north of King's Landing and north-east of Harrenhal. Contents[show] HistoryEdit BackgroundEdit 

Maidenpool is famed in song as the location where the foolish knight Florian met and fell in love with Jonquil. He fell in love with her when he saw her bathing with her sisters. Season 2Edit 

When Lord Tywin Lannister quizzes Arya Stark on where she is from, she says Maidenpool. Tywin realizes she is lying when she cannot identify House Mooton's sigil. She then admits to being from the North, but says that Barrowton is her home town. She identifies the arms of the ruling House Dustin accurately. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Maidenpool is a port town on the east coast of Westeros, on the Bay of Crabs. It is linked to King's Landing by two roads, one that runs along the coast of Crackclaw Point to the east and another that passes directly south through Duskendale in the Crownlands. Fisherfolk northwest of Maidenpool fish the waters in leather coracles and collect clams. Maidenpool's main gate is called the Fool's Gate. 

Maidenpool is sacked during the War of the Five Kings. Jaime, Cleos Frey and Brienne pass through the town on their way to King's Landing, noticing that the town walls are deserted, the gates are smashed, and half the homes and shops are burned or plundered. After the Battle of Duskendale, Randyll Tarly marches on Maidenpool, takes the town and locks Lord William Mooton in a tower cell. Later he begins to rebuild the town while hunting the outlaws in the area.
