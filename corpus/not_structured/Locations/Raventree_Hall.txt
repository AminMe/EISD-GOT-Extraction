In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels Raventree Hall is ancient, dating back to the days of the First Men. The walls are covered in moss, with a tower at each angle in the wall. Two huge, square towers flank the gate. Inside the walls are an outer ward, a large timber keep and a godswood. The godswood contains a single weirwood of massive size. Hundreds of ravens roost on the dead weirwood, which is said to have been poisoned by the Brackens, the Blackwoods' ancestral foes.
