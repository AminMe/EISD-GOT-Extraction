Pennytree is a settlement in the Riverlands, the region controlled by House Tully of Riverrun. It is located northeast of Riverrun, in between Stone Hedge, seat of House Bracken and Raventree Hall, seat of House Blackwood. In the BooksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Pennytree lies in the frontline of frequent border disputes between the Blackwoods and Brackens and possession of the town has changed a lot over the centuries. It is named for a huge old oak tree, to which hundreds of copper pennies have been nailed. 

Duncan the Tall, as a young boy born in Flea Bottom, once squired for a hedge knight called Ser Arlan, hailing from Pennytree. See alsoEdit Pennytree on A Wiki of Ice and Fire (spoilers from the books) ReferencesEdit v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e The Riverlands Regional Capital:
