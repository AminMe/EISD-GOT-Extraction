Greywater Watch is a castle in the Neck. It is ruled by House Reed, a vassal house holding fealty to House Stark of Winterfell. Greywater Watch is nigh-untraceable because it moves. 

It is the home of Jojen and Meera Reed and their father, Lord Howland Reed. It is the southernmost stronghold in the North, and as such its rulers have a longstanding enmity with House Frey, who rule the area of the Riverlands&nbsp;on the southern side of the Neck. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Greywater Watch is the seat of House Reed, one of the most loyal vassals of the Starks. No raven can reach Greywater Watch because it is said to be constantly moving. 

Greywater Watch has not been mentioned in the series yet except for a map that mistakenly refers to the settlement as 'Greytower Watch.' See also Edit Greywater Watch on A Wiki of Ice and Fire v&nbsp;•&nbsp;d&nbsp;•&nbsp;e The North Regional Capital(s):
