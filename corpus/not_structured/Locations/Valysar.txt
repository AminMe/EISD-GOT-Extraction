A map showing the location of Valysar on the continent of Essos. 

Valysar is a town in western Essos. The city is located north-west of Volantis on the western bank of the Rhoyne. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Valysar is a vassal town of Volantis. As it is located on the western side of the river, it does not have any fear of the Dothraki or a need to pay them tribute, unlike its sister-city of Selhorys to the north. Valysar is a middling-sized town by the standards of the Free Cities, but would be a small city by Westerosi standards.
