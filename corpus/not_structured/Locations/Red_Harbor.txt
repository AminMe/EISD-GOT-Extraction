Yara Greyjoy berths her fleet of thirty ships off Red Harbor because it is larger than Lordsport. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Lordsport is a major port in its own right. There is no mention of Red Harbor although the harbors of most of the other Iron Islands have not been named.
