Bhorash is a ruined city in Essos. The city is located on the northern shore of Slaver's Bay. It is northeast of Tolos and west of Meereen. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the city lies to the north-east of the Black Cliffs. Bhorash is connected by Valyrian roads to Mantarys and Tolos. It is in ruins, presumably destroyed in the Doom of Valyria.
