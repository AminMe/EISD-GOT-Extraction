Map showing the location of the Crag on the continent of Westeros. 

The Crag is the stronghold ruled by House Westerling, a vassal of the Lannisters. The castle is run-down and partially ruined, as the Westerlings, though an ancient House with blood of the First Men, have fallen on hard times and can no longer maintain it. The castle is located north-east of Casterly Rock, overlooking the Sunset Sea on the west coast of Westeros. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 2Edit 

Robb Stark is heading to the Crag to settle its surrender. Talisa Maegyr comes to ask Robb for supplies from their maester. She offers to write out a list, but Robb instead asks her come with him. While he's away, Jaime Lannister&nbsp;is caught and returned to the camp. Catelyn Stark, feeling that Rickard Karstark will kill the recaptured Kingslayer&nbsp;before Robb's return the next morning and fearing what that would mean for Sansa and Arya, lets Jaime go under the custody of Brienne of Tarth. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Crag is described as being in a state of extreme disrepair, with its defenses compromised by the family's inability to pay for repairs. The Crag is described as lonely, but also has a somewhat romantic quality to it.
