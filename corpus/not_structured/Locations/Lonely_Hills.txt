The Lonely Hills on the Boltons' map in "Kill the Boy". 

The Lonely Hills are a series of hills in the North, within the lands of House Umber. 

They are located east of Long Lake, just northwest of the Dreadfort, and some distance south from Last Hearth and the Last River. 

The White Knife river flows south out of Long Lake to the west: a tributary of the White Knife originates in the Lonely Hills, merging with the main river further south. Contents[show] HistoryEdit Season 5Edit 

The Lonely Hills appear on a map that the Boltons look over. In the booksEdit
