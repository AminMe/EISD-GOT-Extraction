Great Wyk is one of the Iron Islands, an archipelago located on Ironman's Bay, on the western side of Westeros. It is the largest of the seven main Iron Islands. 

It is also the home of Houses Merlyn, Sparr, and Goodbrother. In the books Edit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Great Wyk is the largest of the seven main islands that make up the Iron Islands, and thus the only one on which certain noble Houses derive more of their wealth from the land than the sea (such as House Goodbrother, which gains its wealth from iron mines in the island's central hills). It is still the second wealthiest of the islands overall, behind Harlaw (which is the second largest of the islands).
