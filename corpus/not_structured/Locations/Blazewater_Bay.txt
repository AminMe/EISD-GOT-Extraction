Blazewater Bay is a region off the north-western coast of the continent of Westeros. It is part of the Sunset Sea. The bay is located between Cape Kraken and the south coast of the Rills. Flint's Finger is located on the southern edge of the bay. In the booksEdit 

In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, Blazewater Bay forms the mouth of the Saltspear, a long, narrow bay between the Barrowlands and the Neck, which in turn is fed by the Fever River.
